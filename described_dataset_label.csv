./images/1.jpg	AACHEN, Hans von	Oil on copper	The painting, displaying the characteristic Mannerist style of the artist, is also known as The Triumph of Justice.
./images/2.jpg	AACHEN, Hans von	Oil on canvas	The representation of this group is related to the frequently depicted sentence by Terence: Sine Cerere et Baccho friget Venus - Without Ceres (bread) and Bacchus (wine) Venus freezes. Aachen gives the mythological figures the facial features of his family: his own, his wife and their son. The motif could allude to the famous picture of the Greek painter Zeuxis. He painted a boy with grapes so naturally that the birds pecked at the painted fruits.The nude figure of a woman viewed from behind, a favourite motif in Rudolfine art, is represented here in a sensually suggestive way. The elongation of the female body is characteristic of the excessively refined Mannerist art and culture prevalent at the court in Prague c. 1600 and can also be found in the work of von Aachen's contemporaries at court, Bartholomäus Spranger and Joseph Heintz the Elder.
./images/3.jpg	AACHEN, Hans von	Copperplate	At the end of the 16th century the court of Emperor Rudolph II in Prague was one of the most important art and cultural centre of Europe. The Emperor gathered together important artists: painters, sculptors, goldsmiths, who developed a characteristic style as important as that of the Fontainebleau school flowered at the same period in France. One component of the Rudolphean style was the painting of the Flemish Spranger, another the German Hans von Aachen and the third the Swiss Joseph Heintz.Aachen studied in Italy, he spent there 14 years and was known as a portraitist. He went to Munich and worked for the Bavarian Prince. He moved to Prague in 1592 and became court painter at the court of Rudolph II.In addition to mythological subjects he painted realistic genre pictures with two-three figures.
./images/4.jpg	AACHEN, Hans von	Oil on canvas	Rudolf II (1552-1612) was the son of the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II. He became King of Hungary in 1572 and King of Bohemia in 1575. Following the death of his father he also became Holy Roman Emperor and Archduke of Austria. His reign was a troubled time of great religious conflicts coupled with the external menace of the Turks. Unfortunately, politics was not a great interest of his. Instead he was familiar with a number of languages and was devoted to art and science, the latter including alchemy and astrology, a highly fashionable preoccupation at that time. He was also fascinated by magic and the occult. At the end of the 1590s mental illness rendered him incapable of governing his empire, which by that time was torn by disputes between Reformation and Counter-Reformation movements. As a result, in 1611, he was forced to cede the crown of Bohemia to his brother Matthias and he died soon afterwards.
./images/5.jpg	AACHEN, Hans von	Oil on canvas	Hans von Aachen was an artist who fully embraced the self-portrait as a means of artistic expression. His earliest self-portrait was executed c. 1574, and he painted several other self-portraits during his career.
./images/6.jpg	AAGAARD, Carl Frederik	Oil on canvas	The painting is signed and dated 'C F Aagaard 1888' at lower left.
./images/7.jpg	AAGAARD, Carl Frederik	Oil on canvas	This painting is unusual in 19th century art in combining landscape with still-life. In the acutely observed flowers the artist has demonstrated his skills as an observer of nature, but in the more distant landscape. The two figures, possibly lovers, are framed by the forward garland but are almost incidental to the composition.
./images/8.jpg	ABADIA, Juan de la	Wood	The archangel Michael was, like St. George the dragon-killer, one of the typically warlike saints so greatly approved in the age of chivalry. The Bible tells us that he fought with Satan for the body of Moses and we can read in the Apocalypse how he defeated the dragon with seven heads and ten horns. St. Michael was therefore looked upon as one of the principal patrons of the Church who, having overcome Satan, could protect all innocent souls from the Devil.This painting illustrates the somewhat provincial style of Juan de la Abadia of Huesca. The heritage of the Trecento can be seen in the delicate, girlish countenance of the saint and the brilliant tints of the wings, but blended with it is the elegance associated with the International Gothic style. The figures are wooden and lifeless and the artist's limited knowledge of anatomy may be seen in his representation of the soul; but the carefully arranged pattern of the floor creates the illusion of space, indicating that the artist was aware of the later developments of Gothic art and was to some extent influenced by early Renaissance art.

./images/11.jpg	ABAQUESNE, MassÃ©ot	Ceramics	This tile floor originally surrounded the altar of the chapel at La Bâtie-d'Urfé. Sphinxes, burning braziers, florets, ribbons, angels and terms float freely in this design, which was inspired by ancient grotesques.

./images/13.jpg	ABBATE, NiccolÃ² dell'	-	The chimney breast was realized by the workshop of Niccolò dell' Abbate. It features figures, putti, flowers, fruit, and symbols (among them the sword symbolizing the constable's office) in trompe-l'oeil painting.
./images/14.jpg	ABBATE, NiccolÃ² dell'	Marble	The chimney breast in the large royal hall was realized by the workshop of Niccolò dell' Abbate. It features figures, putti, flowers, fruit, and symbols (among them the sword symbolizing the constable's office) in pink, white, and black marble.
./images/15.jpg	ABBATE, NiccolÃ² dell'	Oil on canvas	"In a fabulous setting we see the last moments of a stag hunt. The very small size of the figures in the foreground does not prevent the artist from lingering over every detail of the elegant clothing, the hairstyles and the harness of the horses. We sense a refined climate of diversion that was certainly inspired by  the Estense court of the castle of Ferrara, from which ""Camerini"" this painting probably comes. The natural scenery, which shows the influence of Dosso Dossi's landscapes and numerous aspects of Flemish art, is lit up in the background by unreal flashes of light, oscillating between pale pink and gray-green, from which ruins emerge, the spires of fairytale works of architecture."
./images/16.jpg	ABBATE, NiccolÃ² dell'	Oil on canvas	King Francis I of France concentrated his patronage of art and artists on the decoration of the Chateau of Fontainebleau. To this and he imported such major artists as he could. He did get the aging Leonardo, he imported Rosso in 1530, Primaticcio in 1532, then Niccolò dell'Abbate, Vignola, Andrea del Sarto, Cellini. Some stayed, some went back; but the work they left behind was decisive in the replacement of Gothic style in France.The Fontainebleau decorations included a Long Gallery, a Ballroom and several royal rooms. Only a fraction survives, since much were destroyed in later rebuildings, and most of the paintings were drastically restored in the nineteenth century.Niccolò dell'Abbate arrived about 1552. His main contribution was his fantastic landscapes, which are a genre quite apart from either the poetic realism found in late fifteenth-century Italian pictures, or the homely kind in the background of the Raphael cartoons. They have a dreamlike quality with extremes of light and colour, rainbows and flickering storms.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 7 minutes):Cristoph Willibald Gluck: Orfeo, Act I, Orpheus' aria in G Major
./images/17.jpg	ABBATE, NiccolÃ² dell'	Oil on canvas	In this painting - which may belong to a series of landscapes painted in 1570 for the Cabinet du Roi in the Château de Fontainebleau - the artist applies the formula of a vast landscape animated by small, graceful figures. He takes as his source works by Joachim Patenier.
./images/18.jpg	ABBATE, NiccolÃ² dell'	Oil on canvas	This painting is typical of the elegant art emerging in Fontainebleau inspired by Primaticcio.
./images/19.jpg	ABBATI, Giuseppe	Oil on panel	The mid-nineteenth century in Italy was the period of the Risorgimento, the movement that culminated in Italian unification. That movement provided the political and cultural backdrop for one of the most important and influential groups in Italian art in the second half of the nineteenth century: the Macchiaioli. This group of landscape, portrait and genre painters, flourishing from about 1850 to 1880, was based on Florence. The core of the Macchiaioli consisted of eleven painters born between 1824 and 1838, most important of them among the older painters were Giovanni Fattori, Silvestro Lega, Serafino de Tivoli, and Vincenzo Cabianca, while Giuseppe Abbati and Telemaco Signorini belonged to the younger. There were some other artists associated with the group to varying extent, such as Guglielmo Ciardi, Giuseppe de Nittis, Federigo Zandomeneghi, and Giovanni Boldini. The last-named three all took their bearings from France, and eventually moved to Paris.Alongside history paintings, the early period of the Macchiaioli notably included the Castiglioncello School of landscape art, of significance in the 1860s in particular. (The school was named after the Tuscan coastal town where the artists gathered to work.) The painters of this school, among them Giuseppe Abbati, Odoardo Borrani, and Giovanni Fattori, constituted a homogenous subgroup within the Macchiaioli. At first Abbati's art was to the fore, subsequently that of Fattori.Abbati was very taken with the clear, serene light of that part of the country, and with the colours, and he was the most regular of the visitors. A typical painting of the 1860s was his Landscape at Castiglioncello.
./images/20.jpg	ABBATI, Giuseppe	Oil on canvas	To this day, the hilly Tuscan countryside is dotted with olive groves and ominous cypress trees, frequently found along roadsides and near cemeteries. Abbati chose a patch of sandy, yellow road for the foreground, where long afternoon shadows are casting the shades of other cypress trees to be imagined outside of the picture plane. Large areas of different hues are effectively played off against one another in a rather abstract fashion.
./images/21.jpg	ABBATI, Giuseppe	Oil on cardboard	Abbati painted in the cloisters of Santa Croce in Florence in 1861-62 while the monument was being restored. Numerous black and white marble blocks were strewn around the grounds, offering clear-cut shapes and sharp, elementary contrasts. Beyond the empty foreground, a row of stones is placed against the shaded walkway of the cloisters, with only the figure of a worker or stonemason as a living element in this rather abstract composition.
./images/22.jpg	ABBATI, Giuseppe	Oil on panel	More a genre painting than a portrait, this woman is standing near a fireplace resting her hands on the back of a chair, a pose that was customary in portrait photography at that time. The composition focuses on her long, bluish dress and the bonnet, held down by a black scarf, while her features are only summarily executed in large daubs of colours.
./images/23.jpg	ABBATINI, Guido Ubaldo	Oil on canvas	"In Rome it was customary to decorate church choirs on high church holidays with temporary decorations constructed of coloured papier mâché or canvas. The most famous of these are the ones created by Pietro da Cortona for the forty-hour prayer in Rome's San Lorenzo in Damaso during Holy Week in 1633. Drawings and engravings of these temporary ""sacred sets"" are the earliest evidence of the increasing tendency in the seventeenth century to transform church spaces into stages for heavenly apparitions and visions. One of the first decorations belonging to this category was the Cornaro Chapel in Santa Maria della Vittoria in Rome, designed by Gian Lorenzo Bernini. In it architecture, sculpture, and painting combine to form a theatrical whole. The saint and the angel in the famous Ecstasy of St Teresa function as the performers, while the saint's vision is entrusted to the medium of fresco, executed by Guido Ubaldo Abbatini."

He directed the European opposition to Louis XIV of France and, in Great Britain, secured the triumph of Protestantism and of Parliament.

He is best known as the pioneer of the coloured wax relief portrait miniature.He worked in Italy between 1552 and 1565, and thereafter mainly for the Habsburgs. His son Alessandro followed in his father's footsteps, also specializing in mythological reliefs, and marrying the widow of another court artist, Hans von Aachen.Thirteen of Abondio's wax portraits survive, and about sixty medals. He also made the dies for the first coinage of Emperor Rudolf II. Initially his style in metal followed that of Leone Leoni, for the façade of whose house in Milan he carved eight large atlantes in stone, but later included many other influences.

./images/32.jpg	ADAM, Albrecht	Oil on canvas	Albrecht Adam was one of the most celebrated German equestrian and military artists of the early nineteenth century. The present landscape with huntsmen returning from the hunt was commissioned around 1828 as one of a pair of hunting pictures by Felix Georg von Voss, the owner of Schloss Schorssow whose family held substantial estates in Pomerania and Prussia. In the background of the picture is a large, nine-bay country house, shown from the south-east side across the lake identifiable as Schloss Schorssow, built on the banks of Lake Haussee in Pomerania in North-East Germany.
./images/33.jpg	ADAM, Lambert-Sigisbert	Bronze	In the eighteenth century artist strove to invent new techniques, new ways to obtain results with less effort and, mainly, at less cost. Works of art were now marketable items and this raised the issue of how to market them. Porcelain thus came to used as a medium for figurines. Although they were fragile, they had the advantage of possessing colours of permanent freshness. Bronze figurines were more costly, however, they were also more resistant to blow. The technique for manufacturing them was similar to that employed for biscuit. Adam's Child was reproduced in a small size, in bronze rather than biscuit.
./images/34.jpg	ADAM, Lambert-Sigisbert	Lead	It was probably an aid to the success of the grand group of Neptune and Amphitrite for the Bassin de Neptune that it should be executed in lead. The huge lead group is all movement and action - Neptune poised as if about to rise and strike with his trident, and the whole rocky platform with its people and animals about to swing forward over the water.
./images/35.jpg	ADAM, Lambert-Sigisbert	Marble	Speedy in execution, imaginative rather than intellectual, Adam had not a wide range of ideas but he was capable of effective, if unoriginal, sculpture. His Neptune Calming the Waves reveals his ability and his limitations. Back in Paris from Rome in 1733, he completed a model the following year and the piece itself in 1737. Its debt to Bernini needs no emphasizing; nor does the piece, for all its bravura, survive too close a scrutiny of its movement and anatomy. But it has a compensating largeness of effect, despite its small scale, and a welcome vigour. It is a piece of illusionism, with its dramatic movement - Neptune advancing forward to quell the waves, instead of being balanced in the equilibrium Bernini had devised - and its bold flying swag of drapery which emphasises the action.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 3 minutes):Marc-Antoine Charpentier: Marche en Rondeau

The terracotta model for the head of Water in the Hermitage shows that the vein of poetry in Adam's 'fancy pieces' was very real. The limpid treatment of the hair, the ardent yet wistful gaze, reveal an unusual delicacy and response, perhaps more those of a modeller than a carver.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 28 minutes):George Frideric Handel: Water Music, Suite No. 1
./images/38.jpg	ADAM, Nicolas-SÃ©bastien	Bronze	It is doubtful if Nicolas-Sébastien Adam was at all inferior to his elder brother Lambert-Sigisbert. They can be fairly judged by the bronze bas-reliefs each contributed to the chapel at Versailles, where the elder's St Adelaide taking leave of St Odilo is accomplished but fussy when compared to the clearly organized, highly pictorial Martyrdom of Sainte Victoire by Niclas-Sébastien. He indeed practiced sometimes as a painter, and his orientation towards painting was apparent from his sculptural work. His bas-relief is almost a homage to Pietro da Cortona in composition, but executed in a fluent pastiche manner that is closer to Sebastiano RIcci. The dying heroine, the pagan altar, the dramatic action of the aged priest, and the whole classical atmosphere, are ready to be transmuted into another of the younger Adam's reliefs, that of Sacrifice of Iphigenia.
./images/39.jpg	ADAM, Nicolas-SÃ©bastien	Marble	Nicolas-Sébastien was the ideal choice for the tomb of Queen Catharina Opalinska, Queen of Poland and Duchess of Lorraine, set up in 1749 in the church of Bon Secours in his native Nancy. Nevertheless, his brother Lambert-Sigisbert struggled hard to be preferred to the task. But panache was not needed so much as lyricism and a gentle piety, in commemorating the quite unglamorous, humble, religious wife of Stanislas of Lorraine and mother of Marie Leczinska.Bon Secours had been built by Stanislas a few years before with the intention of its containing tombs of himself and his wife, and the church's title might have suggested to Adam the theme he was to illustrate in his touching masterpiece of a soul helped by a vision. The useless royal crown and sceptre, which had proved so barren in life, are deliberately laid aside at the moment of passing from death into immortality. The queen, made youthful again, kneels in prayer, while an angel points her way to heaven. The eagle of Poland, the incense burners that smoke with the queen's praises, are unimportant in the central depiction of a simple allegory.The juxtaposition of the person commemorated and the angel of immortality is not dramatic. In that lack of drama lies its whole point. The hand of the Lord, the revelation of eternal happiness, cannot startle someone who has waited so long for them. The queen's face expresses no surprise, only ecstasy. The angel and she are integrated into a single form, in effect a bas-relief set against the coloured marble of the pyramid; its steep lines are broken by the long undulating diagonal that runs up from the lowest fold in the queen's mantle and culminates in the extended forefinger of the angel's upraised hand.

./images/41.jpg	ADAM, Nicolas-SÃ©bastien	Marble	Adam's art was influenced by the Italian Baroque, which he had assimilated in Rome. Prometheus, the artist's presentation piece for the Academy in 1737, reveals a facile inspiration, great technical skill ostentatiously displayed, and a real sense for the decorative. His Triumph of Neptune and Amphitrite at Versailles, created with his brother Nicolas-Sebastian, is an exemplary work of French Rococo sculptural style.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 13 minutes):Franz Liszt: Prometheus, symphonic poem
./images/42.jpg	ADAM, Nicolas-SÃ©bastien	Marble	Works of minutely detailed character (fashionable in the Rococo period) became veritable 'tours de force' when the sculptor combined the almost excessive preoccupation with details with an endeavour to keep up the 'grand manner' on a reduced scale. Nicolas-Sébastien Adam spent two decades working on the presentation piece he submitted to the Royal Academy in 1762. Yet there is not a trace of weariness in his masterpiece. It has a wonderful verve, yet it is also wonderfully delicate, this miniature Prometheus on his rock having his liver devoured by a vulture. The treatment of the details, even peripheral ones like the torch smoking on the ground, is superb. There is no question that academic statuettes of this type were influential.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 17 minutes):Karl Goldmark: Prometheus Bound, overture op.38
./images/43.jpg	ADAM, Nicolas-SÃ©bastien	Marble	The architect Ange-Jacques Gabriel designed four vases, two representing spring and two autumn, for Louis XV's Château at Choisy, near Sceaux. The sculptors Jean-Baptiste Pigalle and Nicolas-Sébastien Adam each carved one on the theme of autumn (now both in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), and the Flemish-born sculptor Jacques Verberckt (1704-1771) carved the pair dedicated to spring (now in the Musée du Louvre, Paris, and in the Château de Malmaison).Like many garden ornaments of the period of Louis XIV and Louis XV, the vases are indebted to ancient precedent. The kalyx-krater form, based on an ancient Greek vase type, with fluted base and handles springing from satyrs' heads, became a paradigm for Baroque and Rococo garden ornaments.

The house was designed by the Palladian architects James Paine (1717-1789) and Matthew Brettingham (1699-1769) and was loosely based on an original plan by Andrea Palladio for the never-built Villa Mocenigo. At the time a relatively unknown architect, Robert Adam was designing some garden temples to enhance the landscape of the park; Curzon was so impressed with Adam's designs, that Adam was quickly put in charge of the construction of the new mansion.The picture shows the south front.

./images/51.jpg	ADEMOLLO, Luigi	Fresco	Luigi Ademollo, an Italian painter, draftsman, and engraver, was the uncle of the painter Carlo Ademollo (1825-1911). The Tuscan activities of this Lombard painter contributed to the establishing of modern Nea-Classical aesthetics in Florence. His decorative scenographic paintings on subjects drawn from mythology and Greek and Roman history, rich in grandiloquent archeologisms. certainly produced responses from local artists. Two representative examples of Ademollo's style and language are the painting decoration of the Palatine Chapel (1791-92) and of the later (1816) Sala dell'Arca (Room of the Ark) in the Pitti palace.Ademollo decorated the Room of the Ark with biblical scenes inspired by the history surrounding the Holy Ark of the Jewish people. Before the backdrop of classical architecture, a multitude of people are moving in a frieze-like procession with the Holy Ark being carried under the leadership of the high priest. The scenes are rich in narrative detail and reveal the artist's ability for elaborate historical recreations.

In contrast with these is the 'forest room' where a decoration of buildings and scenes of nature merges into endless greenery, creating illusory scenic prospects that rise to the changing sky of the ceiling and are lost in the dream-like images of the garden outside.The picture shows a detail of the decoration of the rooms on the piano nobile of the palazzo, entirely frescoed by Ademollo with mythological subjects, including griffins and garlands of flowers, and some 'woodland' decoration from a series of trompe-l'oeil landscapes.

./images/63.jpg	ADOLPHI, Christoffel	Silver	Michiel de Ruyter (1607-1676) was one of the most famous admirals in Dutch history. He is most famous for his role in the Anglo-Dutch Wars of the 17th century. His victories in the naval battles of the Dutch War of Independence and later during the Anglo-Dutch wars assured his place not only as a national hero, but also as one of the most respected admirals in history. His greatest military achievement was the Four Days' Battle of June 1666, which resulted in defeat for the English navy. De Ruyter was then asked to commission his own portrait in six copies, to be hung in the chambers of the regional offices of the admiralty in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Middelburg, Harlingen, Enkhuizen and Hoorn.The medal is signed on the arm with the monogram 'C.AD.F.'.

./images/65.jpg	ADRIAENSSEN, Alexander	Oil on oak panel	The style of Alexander Adriaenssen, who became a master in Antwerp in 1610, is related to the Haarlem style. He made a number of still-lifes of flowers, but he owes his reputation to his many still-lifes of fish. He depicted with great skill the moist waxiness of fish and oysters.He seems to have arrived fairly quickly at a well-laid-out scheme to which he adhered for the rest of his life. He has a striking diagonal asymmetric composition, with motifs overlapping one another and arranged over several planes, with a generally sober tonality, even tending to monochrome. In the use of some motifs he seems to have been influenced by Frans Snyders.

./images/70.jpg	ADRIANO FIORENTINO	Bronze	The obverse of this medal portrays Ferdinand II (1467-1496), Prince of Capua, Duke of Calabria, and King of Naples (1495-96), who recovered his kingdom from French occupation. A gifted humanist prince, Ferdinand was loved by the people, who affectionately addressed him in the diminutive Ferrandino. When his father, the unpopular Alfonso II, became king (1494), Ferdinand took command of Neapolitan troops opposing the advance of the French king Charles VIII in northern Italy. Failing to halt the French, Ferdinand returned to Naples and became king upon the abdication of his father on Jan. 23, 1495. The following month, however, the French captured Naples, and Ferdinand withdrew to Sicily. Aided by a Spanish army and the Venetian fleet, he recovered almost all his lands by the summer of 1496 and was received triumphantly by the populace of Naples. His sudden death opened the way for Spanish usurpation of the Neapolitan throne.The reverse of the medal depicts Felicitas Seated, Holding Ears of Corn and Waving Cornucopiae.
./images/71.jpg	ADRIANO FIORENTINO	Bronze	Adriano Fiorentino, a Florentine artist active in Naples, made an impressive bronze bust of Pontano, as well as an all'antica portrait relief in marble and a medal. Giovanni Gioviano Pontano (1429-1503) was a poet, humanist, and statesman. He was the presiding spirit of the Accademia Pontaniana, and chief minister and tutor to the Aragonese Kings of Naples. He was also the most innovative and versatile Latin poet of Quattrocento Italy. His Two Books of Hendecasyllables, given the subtitle Baiae by their first editor Pietro Summonte, experiment brilliantly with the metrical form associated principally with the ancient Latin poet Catullus. The poems are the elegant offspring of Pontano's leisure, written to celebrate love, good wine, friendship, nature, and all the pleasures of life to be found at the seaside resort of Baiae on the Bay of Naples.In all three forms, Adriano depicts Pontano as an older man, his sparse remaining hair is wavy, and his rather severe demeanour is expressed through a furrowed brow, pronounced veins and perhaps a scar at the temples, deeply creased cheeks, and a slightly downturned mouth. In the bust and relief he wears classical garb, with his cloak held at the shoulder by a fibula.

./images/74.jpg	ADRIANO FIORENTINO	Bronze	In the second half of the fifteenth century, there was a demand of sculptures of classical subjects due to the rediscovery of antique sculpture. The pose of Adriano's statuette probably was partly based on specific antique sculpture, but Venus standing on a shell shows also the influence of Botticelli's famous paintingThe Birth of Venus,now in the Uffizi.Adriano Fiorentino (Adriano de Giovanni de' Maestri) was active in Florence. This statuette is one of the rare works signed by the artist: it is inscribed underneath in abbreviated Latin: HADRIANUS/ ME.F. (Adriano/ made/ me).
./images/75.jpg	AELST, Willem van	Oil on canvas	"Willem van Aelst signed and dated this ""Ontbijtje"" (breakfast piece)."
./images/76.jpg	AELST, Willem van	Oil on canvas	In addition to fruit and flower still-lifes with cool colour harmonies, van Aelst also enjoyed painting elegant hunting weapons and dead animals placed in a dark corner by a wall for rich clients. One example is this still-life.A dead partridge is hanging by its leg from a piece of string. Its wings and feathers, which are grey with brownish patches, open up towards us at the bottom like a fan. The fly on the light-coloured feathers has an illusionist effect: disproportionately large in size, it belongs to the realistic level of the picture rather than its fictitious one, so that the viewer is given the impression that a real fly is crawling across the painting. The bird's head has been pressed slightly towards the middle by the blue hunting bag with the golden fringe and the adjustable shoulder strap which is lying on the stone shelf. Beside the partridge a hunting horn, also adorned with tassels, and a powder bottle have been hung up. The shiny, metallic grey of the hunting horn has been painted by the artist with a highly sensitive eye for the different hues of the bird's fluffy, grey feathers on its breast and as a contrast to the grey of the wings which merges into white towards the middle.But, although the bird has been rendered with almost unsurpassable precision, it has an odd abstract quality. It seems as if, in its material consistency, it had undergone a synthesis with the implement of civilization by which it was pursued - as if it was no longer merely part of nature and a victim, but an aesthetically refined and ennobled form of existence.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 9 minutes):Antonio Vivaldi: Concerto in B flat major RV 362 op. 8 No. 10 (Hunt)
./images/77.jpg	AELST, Willem van	Oil on canvas	Willem van Aelst was a still-life specialist prized for his lovely flower and fruit pieces, and he has been mentioned as a sometime follower of Kalf. He also painted a number of elegant game pictures in a clear light. They show close views of dead prey - occasionally accompanied by killed poultry - that include scrupulously painted guns, hunting bags and horns, bells and other gear of the sport. As most trophy pieces they were designed as representative pictures of the sport, not records of the spoils of a specific hunt.In this picture the painter displayed the finely worked equipment of the huntsman on a marble ledge: a velvet hunting bag with chamois strap, trimmed with gold embroidery and fringes, and a tasseled horn. Above it he suspended the exquisite catch of a fat partridge and three small game birds. The exquisite blue of the velvet contains the expensive pigment lapis lazuli, which yields ultramarine colour when ground. It was imported from China. Van Aelst's lavish use of it reinforces the preciousness of the arrangement and confirms its destination in a wealthy home. Most Dutch painters used cheaper, less stable blue pigments.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 3 minutes):Carl Maria von Weber: Der Freischütz, Act III: Jagerchor

./images/79.jpg	AELST, Willem van	Oil on canvas	The picture depicts a still-life with peaches and grapes fallen from an over-turned basket, resting on a partly-draped marble ledge. The painting has been reduced from a vertical to horizontal format, resulting in the loss of the signature.
./images/80.jpg	AELST, Willem van	Oil on canvas	Van Aelst painted this still-life (signed and dated lower right) in 1650, the year in which he entered the service of Ferdinand II de'Medici, grand duke of Toscany, and of his brother, Cardinal Carlo de'Medici. It is possible, that this painting was executed for the cardinal, who was the artist's main patron in Florence.In this still-life Van AElst continues the tradition of fruit and flower painting that flourished in Delft from the early 1630s onward with the work of Balthasar van der Ast, Gillis de Bergh, and Evert van Aelst, Willem's uncle.

./images/83.jpg	AELST, Willem van	Oil on canvas	Intense colours characterize the still-lifes of Van Aelst, who worked for a time in France and Italy. In this painting, which was commissioned by Cardinal Giovan Carlo de' Medici, the intense blue of the table-cloth catches one's eye. The large crystal vase in the centre of the composition was probably in the possession of the Medici family. The painter placed his signature and the date on the hem of the white tablecloth: W.A.Aelst. 1652.

./images/91.jpg	AELST, Willem van	Oil on copper	Although Van Aelst is most admired for elegant still-lifes with fine glassware, silver vessels, fruit and flowers, this representation of humbler motifs must be considered one of his finest early work. The subject here is a 'vanitas', with a recently extinguished candle set in a holder on a stone ledge, and a mouse nibbling at walnut crumbs.Although mice occur in 17th-century still-lifes (e.g. in paintings by Abraham van Beyeren, Georg Flegel, Jacob Vosmaer), the specific combination of a mouse and an expired candle is unique.
./images/92.jpg	AELST, Willem van	Oil on canvas	Van Aelst's still-lifes are infinitely various. Here, he perhaps suggests the category's classical roots: the Greek painter Zeuxis's grapes, so lifelike that birds tried to eat them, and the split pomegranate recalling Demeter's bargain, and announcing winter's return, as Proserpina descends to Hades once more.
./images/93.jpg	AELST, Willem van	Oil on canvas	Willem van Aelst was a still-life specialist prized for his lovely flower and fruit pieces, and he has been mentioned as a sometime follower of Kalf. The eminent flower painter Rachel Ruysch was his pupil.This floral still-life has symbolic significance. The blooms, shown in all their glory, already imply the fading and dying that is to come, a reminder of the transience of beauty. A similar idea is communicated by the holes eaten in the leaves, while the open pocket-watch serves to suggest the passage of earthly time, as well as standing more generally for the importance of good measure. Yet the hour cannot be read from the face of the watch, and this might suggest that time is not passing, that the painter has brought time to a standstill in his work, overcoming the very transience of things.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 2 minutes):Franz Schubert: Blumenlied (Flower Song) D 431

Susanna and the Elders comes from the circle of Aert van Ort and it illustrates the opening episode of the Old Testament story in which the beautiful and virtuous Susanna attracts the lustful attention of two elders. This was probably paired with another window or two illustrating the story's conclusion. Hundreds of roundels survive, suggesting that this form of relatively inexpensive domestic art enjoyed great popularity.

./images/99.jpg	AERTSEN, Pieter	Oil on wood	The fruit and vegetables presented in Aertsen's paintings are peasant foods, but they are a feast for the eyes. His market scenes are not slices of everyday life, but plausible inventions. Many of the fruit and vegetables depicted in his work have sexual connotations and some of them were eaten as aphrodisiacs.In the present painting, the artist juxtaposes the biblical narrative with a market scene, encouraging beholders to ponder the relationship between love and lust, between sexual attraction and visual seduction. The foreground of the painting is filled with sexual innuendoes. On the left side, a man shows a woman his strings of onions. Although this may look innocent and mundane, onions were commonly used as aphrodisiacs. Furthermore, according to proverbial folklore, peeling an onion was like peeling off clothes, for it could easily result in tears. On the right, a man grasps a black rooster, a phallic allusion, in one hand, and an egg basket, a vaginal allusion, in the other.
./images/100.jpg	AERTSEN, Pieter	Oil on wood	In the 16th century Antwerp rose to the position of the most significant trade and banking centre in Europe. In the area around this town there was an extensive cottage industry for the processing of English cloth and the production of glassware, soap, sugar, and other goods. The changing conditions in agriculture were almost equally revolutionary. The population increase at the beginning of the 16th century meant a greater demand for food, which had to be satisfied buy an agricultural system that was now no longer catering merely to itself but also to the market.After years of inadequate supplies the increase in food production was experienced by the general public as a great improvement - so much so, in fact, that it virtually demanded some form of artistic expression. Celebrating this new wealth in an almost solemn manner, the Amsterdam-born painter Pieter Artsen, who lived in Antwerp in 1555-56, depicted market scenes as part of biblical illustrations. However, instead of following traditional conventions and playing only a minor part in these illustrations, these market scenes dominate the biblical motifs so much that the latter are literally pushed into the background.In this painting Christ and the Adulteress, the biblical event takes place at the back, on the left, while the foreground is dominated by a market scene with peasants offering clay pots, baskets laden with fruit, vegetables such as onions, carrots, cucumbers and cabbages, as well as eggs, loaves of bread and large jugs of milk. It is this foreground which attracts our attention. There is also a peculiar mixture of time levels: the biblical scenario (with people wearing the clothes of antiquity) and the contemporary market scene (with sixteenth-century peasants) are intricately interwoven, as is shown in the Roman soldiers storming past the market stall. The same feature can be found in numerous other paintings of Aertsen.
./images/101.jpg	AERTSEN, Pieter	Oil on wood	"Firmly positioned in front of the imposing chimney-piece, the cook stands surrounded by the food she is preparing to cook: voluminous cabbages in a basket, and fowls and a leg of meat skewered on a spit which she holds firmly in one hand, whilst with the other she grabs a skimming ladle. The sculptural silhouette with its powerful arms, its solid body and vigorously modelled face radiates a strong sense of assurance. The fact that she is looking towards the unseen part of the room suggests that something is going on there that the viewer is unable to see. Pieter Aertsen made use several times of this form of composition in which a single, solidly-built figure occupies the entire panel in a vertical format which accentuates his or her solidity. This is an invention by the artist, which although originating in the foregrounds of the works of Jan van Hemessen, has no real precedent in the Antwerp painting of the period.Even though he never painted a picture not containing a human figure, Pieter Aertsen played an essential role in the emergence of the still-life by granting a dominating place to objects and to victuals, which he represents in all their triviality. Whilst every element appears to have been observed with attention to real-life detail, the image has nonetheless been recomposed in the studio. What cook would place small fowls and a heavy leg of lamb on the same spit? We also find the same kitchen utensils, furniture and victuals, differently interlinked, in many of the artist's compositions. Whilst the household objects are drawn from life, the classical lines of the chimney are taken from the architectural treaty of the Italian Sebastiano Serlio, whom Aertsen would have known from the Antwerp edition of his works in 1549.The total absence of religious subject matter, which still underlay all genre scenes at the time, is another stroke of daring by the painter, even if 16th century viewers would have immediately recognised, in the cook, the Martha of the gospel narrative, who is busy preparing the meal whilst her sister Mary is listening to Christ's words. This image also has a moralising content and should be read as a warning against the dangers of the pleasures of the flesh, ""voluptas carnis""."
./images/102.jpg	AERTSEN, Pieter	Oil on canvas	
./images/103.jpg	AERTSEN, Pieter	Oil on panel	Interiors with merry companies or drunken brawls became very popular in the 17th century, and the work of Pieter Aertsen was seen as the first step on that path. This picture shows a merry company at an egg dance. The object was to keep dance while kicking the egg round in a circle without breaking it, then covering it with a bowl, again using only one feet.
./images/104.jpg	AERTSEN, Pieter	Oil on wood	Genre-painting, as an independent subject, originated in the Netherlands in the sixteenth century. Before then scenes from everyday life had often been depicted in the background of pictures with a primarily religious content, but it was only after about the middle of the sixteenth century that many painters began to feel their principal task was to represent everyday life for its own sake. With Pieter Bruegel the Elder, also called Peasant Bruegel, genre painting came to be generally accepted and found a great many adherents in the Netherlands. Pieter Aertsen, who was born in Amsterdam and worked mainly in his native city and in Antwerp, was one of the most eminent of these. Most of his works depict market vendors, scenes at fairs or kitchen interiors, with an abundance of carefully painted still-life motifs.In this painting he depicts an old Dutch peasant taking his produce to the market, on his head a heavy tub, in his right hand a brace of mallard and a basket of eggs. A peasant girl in the background kneels by a tray of pasties or loaves. The painter has achieved an effect of monumentality by using large spots of colour and clear outlines and by enclosing his powerfully modelled figures within the confines of a narrow space. Aertsen's great virtue lies in his sincerity and simplicity, particularly noticeable if we compare his work with later genre-scenes.
./images/105.jpg	AERTSEN, Pieter	Oil on wood	
./images/106.jpg	AERTSEN, Pieter	Oil on oak	"This Market Scene - a painting in vertical format - shows a column of sea food on the left, building up and culminating in a ray and - directly opposite, on the right - a large number of fruits of the field and the garden. Wedged between this enormous abundance of produce, the farmer and his wife appear to be mere appendages whose job is only that  of proudly pointing with silent gestures to the victuals that are on offer.The ostentatious wealth of fruit and vegetables in the market scenes of Aertsen and Beuckelaer may lead to the false conclusion that the population had plenty to eat. But although more was being offered on the markets, this did not meet the demands of the urban population, who had to pay exorbitant prices for agricultural produce in comparison to what they actually earned. And so, the horn-of-plenty motif of these market pictures reflects far more the perception of those who benefited, that is, the newly-rich farmers. In this way the artist emphasized the commercial aesthetics of agricultural products from the farmers' fields and gardens, products that were meant to arouse in the viewer the desire to buy, though not in the sense of present-day advertising.However, this does not exclude the possibility of ambivalent reasoning behind such paintings. While stimulating people's cravings and appealing to their needs, they often contained a subtle element of criticism, particularly in Aertsen's biblically motivated pictures. This criticism concerned the contradiction between people's consumer habits and the demand of temperance (""fasting""). While this critical element was still obvious in Aertsen's paintings, it seems to have disappeared almost completely in Beuckelaer's.This painting has a multiple theme. The abundance of the market could be at the same time a representation of the Four Elements and an allegory of the Five Senses. Also the market woman is being pestered by a bird-catcher, who is gripping a duck round the neck with obvious erotic overtones - as well as a realistic representation. The painting is also a moral lesson, extolling moderation and restraint in contrast to the physical and sensual pleasured offered, for instance, in the plumpness of the fruit. In other paintings Aertsen introduced a religious scene in the background by way of admonition."
./images/107.jpg	AERTSEN, Pieter	Oil on oak wood	
./images/108.jpg	AERTSEN, Pieter	Oil on oak	The painting is an Ecce Homo fragment. Similarly to other biblical paintings of Aertsen, the biblical event takes place at the back, while the foreground is dominated by a market scene.. Somewhere in the background, the picture - cut off at the top - affords a small glimpse of the platform where the masses are shouting 'Barabbas' (John 19:4-6). This is optically overlaid by the bow-shaped arrangement of carts and market stalls - a reversal of emphasis which is typical of Aertsen.
./images/109.jpg	AERTSEN, Pieter	Oil on wood	The painting demonstrates a wide range of agricultural products, made possible by the improvements in production methods. Offering her fruits and vegetables, the woman is almost an appendage to her produce. Despite all exaggeration, the picture quite adequately shows the new economic prosperity of the time. At the same time, however, it still contains a background scene in genre style of embracing lovers in a stable, thus relating the painting to late medieval peasant satires. Peasants were regarded as lustful, sensuous and carnal by the middle classes.
./images/110.jpg	AERTSEN, Pieter	Oil on panel	In the 16th and 17th centuries it was quite common for theologians to see a slaughtered animal as symbolizing the death of a believer. Allusions to the 'weak flesh' (cf. Matthew 16:41) may well have been associated with Aertsen's Butcher's Stall where - like on his fruit and vegetable stalls - a seemingly infinite abundance of meat has been spread out.In this picture, the viewer's senses are immediately assaulted by the profusion of life-size comestibles. Amid fowls, sausages, beef, pork, fish, butter, cheese and pretzel, the eye of a flayed ox's head disconcertingly seems to watch the viewer. Each object is a masterful still-life. Like Lucas van Leyden and some other Netherlandish artists, Aertsen inverted the traditional foreground-subject relationship; his narrative occurs in the background. Almost unnoticed at first, the stall permits glimpses of a tavern on the right and a landscape behind. The ground around the inn is covered with oyster and mussel shells, which in some context - as here - allude to their consumption as an aphrodisiac. Among the tavern's revellers is a prostitute with a possible customer.Meanwhile, groups of people, dressed in contemporary Netherlandish attire, walk through the countryside towards the church visible at the far left. Only the mother riding the donkey stops to give alms to the poor. She is the Virgin Mary. Led by Joseph, she and her son are journeying to Egypt, to escape Herod. This is a very different presentation than the standard flight into Egypt since no idols fall, no miracles occur, no angels or servants direct the way. Although beset by their own troubles, the Holy Family shares what they have with the less fortunate. No halos signal their divinity, rather, Aertsen accented their humanity to construct a moral about daily personal decisions. His pilgrimage of life offers a choice between a materialistic and morally questionable existence on the one hand and the spiritual path of the Holy Family on the other.Aertsen and Joachim Beuckelaer, his nephew and pupil, popularized peasant and market scenes such as this, which typically contain half-hidden moralizations and religious themes. Through their impetus in Antwerp and Amsterdam, where they painted, peasant and market scenes evolved into a separate artistic specialization around the mid-sixteenth century.
./images/111.jpg	AERTSEN, Pieter	Oil on wood	Pieter Aertsen was a Dutch painter who had a workshop in Antwerp for several years. He painted altarpieces, but also peasant scenes with a moralizing undertone and kitchen still-lifes with religious themes in the background. He continued this work following his return to Amsterdam in around 1557, concentrating henceforth more on the latter genre. This painting may have been produced during his Amsterdam period.The subject of the work has long been debated, although we can be sure it is not simply a peasant scene. it was once believed to be a portrait of the artist's family, but that hypothesis was rejected some time ago. The scene has all the elements of a rural booze-up. Much drink is being consumed, sausages grilled and bacon fried. There are festive biscuits on the table and a tray of waffles. Crowns like the one worn by the boy were used on the Feast of Epiphany, but also during other winter festivities, including Shrove Tuesday. Neither holiday is being celebrated here, however. The bird-cage next to the door on the left tells us that the scene is taking place in a house of ill repute, such as a tavern or brothel. Other elements combine to suggest the latter - the way the young man places his arm around the girl's waist, the copious eating and drinking, the aggression symbolized by the man with the two weapons, and the foolishness reflected by the king's crown. Like many of Aertsen's paintings, this work has both a moralizing and admonitory content, revealed by the presence of three men of different ages, each symbolizing a generation, around one woman.There is some remarkable innovation in this painting. The figures in the foreground are shown full-length in the middle of the small space, which, together with the monumental format, testifies to the emancipation of non-religious themes in painting around this period.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 26 minutes):Johann Sebastian Bach: Cantata BWV 212 (Bauernkantate)
./images/112.jpg	AERTSEN, Pieter	Oil on wood	A remarkable feature of this painting is the the still-life and a biblical scene (here Christ with Mary and Martha) composed together. The effect of the compostion was strongly disturbed by cutting the lower part of the painting (about 9 cm was cut for unknown reasons).
./images/113.jpg	AERTSEN, Pieter	Oil on panel	In the 1550s Pieter Aertsen produced several major altarpieces, however, little remains of them, since many were destroyed in the Iconoclasm of 1566. Two panels are in the Rijksmuseum which once belonged to the same triptych with the Adoration of the Magi: the larger being the central panel, the other the left wing. On the reverse side of the left wing the scene of Circumcision (or the Presentation in the Temple) can be seen.

He made something of a speciality in painting exotic animals, and was a frequent visitor to the menageries which were such a feature of London Life at this date.
./images/122.jpg	AGNOLO DI POLO	Gilt and painted terracotta	This figure of Mary Magdalene is one of the few extant documented works by Agnolo di Polo. It was made for the Ospedale della Morte in Pistoia in 1495. Documents show that the officers of the Sapienza in Pistoia ordered a terracotta figure of Mary Magdalene to be made for the oratory attached to the Ospedale della Morte on August 16, 1495. A local master, Bernardino del Signoraccio, painted the figure next year, 1496.The figure suffered damage in 1498, and Agnolo repaired it in 1500 and replaced the broken right hand with one in wood.

But whereas the the Mary of Valois monument has its place in the context of court art, the Tarlati monument belongs in the democratic tradition of Tuscan sculpture. Lacking the refinement and elegance of Tino's tomb, it celebrates in simple, graphic style Tarlati's administration.

./images/154.jpg	AIVAZOVSKY, Ivan Konstantinovich	Oil on canvas	Towards the 1850s the romantic features in Aivazovsky’s work became increasingly pronounced. This can be seen quite clearly in one of his best and most famous paintings The Ninth Wave.

./images/162.jpg	AKOTANTOS, Angelos	Tempera and leaf on panel	"In the years that preceded the Turkish conquest of Constantinople and the ultimate fall of the Byzantine Empire, the Byzantine state had been restricted to the areas around Thrace and the Morea. The difficult circumstances and the insecurity that reigned led the artists of the Capital to seek safer places and new markets. Crete, an island which had been under Venetian domination since 1210, and which was flourishing economically, was one such place. Archival sources mention at least six painters from Constantinople who lived and worked at Chandax (the medieval name for the present-day city of Herakleion in Crete) at the beginning of the 15th century; among them were John Apokaukos and Nicholas Philanthropenos. The wave of ""artistic migration"" which went on even after the fall of Constantinople to the Turks (1453), led to the spread of the art of the Capital to the island and was a contributing factor in the creation of a particular school of painting, known as the ""Cretan School"", which was to dominate the art scene of the post-Byzantine years.Among the artists who lived and worked at Chandax during this period, worth mentioning is the painter Angelos. More than 15 icons found today on Crete, Naxos, Patmos, Zakynthos, and in museums and private collections, bear his signature - ""cheir Angelou"" (by the hand of Angelos) - or are attributed to him on the basis of their stylistic features. The great number of icons leads us to suppose that Angelos must have had an important workshop in Chandax. Additional information on the painter is provided by the Venetian archives. In them there is a will, dated 1436, signed by one Angelos Akotantos, who has been identified with the painter whose name appears on the icons."

./images/170.jpg	ALBANI, Francesco	Fresco	The picture shows the painting on the ceiling vault of the piano nobile loggia in the Palazzo Verospi, painted by Francesco Albani. The depictions are: Phoebus-Apollo and Personifications of the Seasons in the centre panel; Genii of Morning and Evening Twilight in the ovals; The Planetary Gods; Genii of Morning and Night with their Children Sleep and Death in the spandrels.Since antiquity, colonnades and porticoes with painted decoration have been distinguishing features of the palaces of ruling houses. In the seventeenth century the main focus in the painting of a loggia, an indispensable feature of the piano nobile in palaces and villas in Rome and elsewhere, was the vault. The original pattern for the Roman loggia was theloggia of the Villa Farnesina,painted by Raphael with free-floating figures in the spandrels and caps of the vault. The piano nobile loggia in the Palazzo Verospi, painted by Albani follows this pattern, but borrowings from theceiling of the Galleria Farnese,fromReni's AuroraandGuercino's Auroraare also present.
./images/171.jpg	ALBANI, Francesco	Fresco	The ceiling painting represents Jupiter and Ganymede. The architectural painting was executed by the specialist Angelo Michele Colonna.
./images/172.jpg	ALBANI, Francesco	Oil on canvas	Albani was a painter belonging to the Bologna school. He was influenced by Domenichino and Raphael, and worked in the workshop of Annibale Carracci in Rome.
./images/173.jpg	ALBANI, Francesco	Oil on copper	Albani painted many versions of this subject. One of the best is the large altarpiece in the church of San Bartolomeo in Bologna, to which this painting is closely related.

./images/175.jpg	ALBANI, Francesco	Oil on copper	
./images/176.jpg	ALBANI, Francesco	Oil on copper	The composition and figural types of this Holy Family or The Rest on the Flight into Egypt, especially the statuesque Madonna, owe much to Annibale Carracci, while the soft modeling and freshness of colour, emphasized by the luminosity of the copper support, is highly characteristic of Albani.
./images/177.jpg	ALBANI, Francesco	Oil on copper	Small, highly finished cabinet pictures were a specialty of Albani's production and proved to be enormously popular with collectors, especially in France.  Many were painted on copper, a technique he had learned during his years working in the studio of Denys Calvaert, a Flemish artist who had settled in Bologna and operated a successful workshop.This devotional image of the Holy Family appears to have been particularly popular and it is known in a number of variations.
./images/178.jpg	ALBANI, Francesco	Oil on canvas	Albani is a typical representative of the reform movement introduced by Carracci. As a student of the Bolognese artists and a colleague of Annibale who collaborated on the decoration of the Aldobrandini lunettes, he had developed a degree of confidence in his choice and application of stylistic means that allowed him not only to handle large wall areas, but also to create small and intimate devotional pictures.In his Sacra Famiglia or Holy Family Albani finds that characteristic blend of sovereign grace and delicacy that today's spectator may find slightly disturbing. Those of us who regard such emotional emphasis and charm with some suspicion tend to forget the specific tasks and needs these pictures were intended to fulfil in order to satisfy a highly educated and cultivated group of buyers. The usual setting for pictures on this theme was a niche in the bedroom of a patrician house or palace intended for devotional purposes. This function also explains some of the typical traits of such a picture: the intimacy of a family gathering, framed by fragments of great architecture, the gestures of devotion of the two angels and the meditative attitude of the elderly Joseph - all signals with which the contemporary spectator would have been able to identify clearly.
./images/179.jpg	ALBANI, Francesco	Oil on canvas	Francesco Albani, a follower of the Carracci in Bologna, was famous and popular with his contemporaries for his graceful, if somewhat sentimental religious and mythological paintings.
./images/180.jpg	ALBANI, Francesco	Oil on canvas	This painting was probably painted as a pendant to Annibale Carracci's Landscape with Diana and Callisto (collection of the Duke of Sutherland, St Boswells). Carracci developed the composition of The Toilet of Venus several years after his Landscape with Diana and Callisto, and the greatest part of its execution was left to Albani, his pupil. ALbani later painted his own interpretations of Carracci's mythological inventions.
./images/181.jpg	ALBANI, Francesco	Oil on canvas	In 1621, Ferdinando Gonzaga, the Duke of Mantua, commissioned a series of The Story of Venus for his Villa Favorita. Completed in 1633, these pictures are enlarged versions of the round compositions of a cycle formerly executed for the prince Borghese towards 1615-17. The Toilet of Venus belongs to the series.

./images/183.jpg	ALBANI, Francesco	Fresco	The picture shows the view of the Galleria, looking south. Between the doors the scene depicting the Sirens is visible.Vincenzo Giustiniani (1564-1637) was one of the most brilliant, and knowledgeable lovers of art in early seventeenth-century Rome. He assembled a renowned collection of roughly 1.800 works of classical sculpture and 600 paintings, among them eleven of Caravaggio's most important works. He purchased a villa at Bassano Romano in 1595 which was then thoroughly remodeled and enlarged. The artists who painted there between 1595 and 1604 all worked in the Mannerist style.The north wing of the enlarged palace was erected in 1607-09 and the painted decoration was accomplished in 1609-10. There are three rooms in the north wing, the Sala della Felicità Eterna (painted by Paolo Guidottiin 1610), the Sala di Diana (painted by Domenichinoin 1609) and the Galleria (painted by Francesco Albani and assistants in 1609-10).In the Galleria, Albani painted the legend of Phaethon, the youth who disrupted the path of the sun. The protagonists in Albani's wall pictures are seen reacting with violent gestures and upward gazes at the central event of the fall of Phaethon on the ceiling. The entire Phaethon legend, as related in Ovid's Metamorphoses, is illustrated on the ceiling and walls in episodes that are part dramatic, part lyrical. Albani designed the eight scenes on the walls as imaginary tapestries.Albani's cycle was highly praised through the whole of the eighteenth century. Later the Phaethon cycle and its painter came to be forgotten, and have only now rediscovered by art historian and appreciated anew.
./images/184.jpg	ALBANI, Francesco	Fresco	In the Galleria, Albani painted the legend of Phaethon, the youth who disrupted the path of the sun. The protagonists in Albani's wall pictures are seen reacting with violent gestures and upward gazes at the central event of the fall of Phaethon on the ceiling. By contrast, the assembly of gods in heaven is comparatively static - except for the figure of Phaethon plunging earthward upside-down. Apollo has raised an arm as a sign of his sadness, and Jupiter is flinging his thunderbolt. Mercury is pointing at the tumbling youth.

./images/192.jpg	ALBEREGNO, Jacobello	Tempera on panel	From the demolished church of San Giovanni Evangelista on Torcello, the polyptych portrays with exemplary clarity one of the visions described by St John in the Book of Revelations.
./images/193.jpg	ALBEREGNO, Jacobello	Tempera on panel	The picture shows the central panel of the Polyptych of the Apocalypse. In the centre of the polyptych is God the Father in Glory with the Lamb, between the symbols of the four Evangelists.The ineffably expressive naturalness which makes the central panel of Alberegno's signed triptych so admirable appears again in the panels of the Polyptych with five episodes from the Apocalypse, originally placed in the church of St. John the Evangelist at Torcello. In the central panel for example, where St. John the Evangelist looks up from his writing to admire the Eternal in glory with the Lamb of God, surrounded by the symbols of the four Evangelists with wings covered with eyes, being worshipped by twenty-four venerable old men, here too the theme, though very complex, comes through with exemplary clarity because of the subtle expressiveness of the details which frees the sacred vision of every transcendent abstraction.
./images/194.jpg	ALBEREGNO, Jacobello	Tempera on panel	Even more in the four minor panels of the Polyptych of the Apocalypse the transcendental significance of the gold background pales before the freshness and inventiveness of Jacobello Alberegno's imagination. As with the other scenes, so with the 'Harvest of the World', the text of the Book of the Apocalypse (XIII, vv. 17-18) is closely followed: 'And another angel came out of the temple... and he too had a sharpened sickle. And another angel came out from the altar... saying: wield your sharpened sickle and harvest the grapes of the world, for the fruit is now ripe'. The detailed and penetrating transcription of the sacred text into pictorial form seems to be softened by the enchanting addition of an arbour of black grapes with bunches of the fruit hanging heavy with juice and leaves which are already showing signs that Autumn is drawing to a close.
./images/195.jpg	ALBEREGNO, Jacobello	Tempera on panel	Much more of an innovator than either Catarino or Lorenzo Veneziano was Jacobello Alberegno, who in the Triptych with Crucifixion and Saints, his only signed work, reveals himself to be an artist of penetrating refinement. If it is true that the two lateral saints, St Gregory and St Jerome, are examples of stylized Gothic figures, the images of the small central panel display a naturalness worthy of one of the best of Giotto's disciples. An extraordinary human dimension seems to govern the expression of sentiments in the picture: a grief-stricken St John the Evangelist clutches his cloak to his breast while the Virgin extends imploring arms and stares transfixed with anguish at her crucified son.
./images/196.jpg	ALBERTI, Antonio	Fresco	The oratory at the west edge of the city centre of Urbino was erected c. 1393. Nothing is known about the commissioning of the paintings on the walls, acycle depicting scenes from the life of St John the Baptist.The unidentified patron was probably from Rome from where the Salimbeni brothers, Lorenzo and Jacopo, came to Urbino for this commission. Stylistic analysis tells us that another painter was also engaged for the wall frescoes in the oratory. Antonio Alberti was responsible for the scenes from the St John cycle on the left-hand wall and on the inner façade.The picture shows the view of the left-hand (east) long wall of the oratory with fragments of the St John cycle in the upper register. The scenic compartments are considered to be the work of Antonio Alberti.The lower register of the east wall includes several votive pictures, separately framed but also painted on the wall, that must have been executed at roughly the same time as the cycle. The two votive paintings with an enthroned Madonna and saints were painted by the Salimbeni brothers.

./images/201.jpg	ALBERTI, Giovanni	Fresco	The Sala Clementina in the west wing of the Vatican Palace was painted between 1596 and 1602 by the quadratura painters Giovanni and Cherubino Alberti. In the centre of the illusionistic ceiling opening St Clement is depicted in glory, framed by a number of virtues and by huge cartouches with the papal coat of arms.
./images/202.jpg	ALBERTI, Leon Battista	Photo	"In 1470 Alberti produced designs for the basilica of Sant'Andrea in the centre of Mantua. The site was particularly important to Ludovico Gonzaga (1412-1478), marquis of the city, because it stood close by the Gonzaga palace and contained a relic, the supposed Blood of Christ.Alberti's design for the façade of Sant'Andrea, like that of the Rimini Temple for Sigismondo Malatesta, draws its inspiration from Roman triumphal arches, but the Mantuan church takes the idea much further, its design at once more monumental and more complex, adapting a classical form rather than seeking to replicate it.

./images/206.jpg	ALBERTI, Leon Battista	Photo	Alberti furnished the design for the façade of the church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence. The white-and-green marble structure is the only Florentine church façade on a grand scale to be built during the Renaissance. In its basic design Alberti followed the Romanesque but classicising façade of San Miniato al Monte, a church overlooking Florence, and divided the structure into an arcaded lower story surmounted by a temple design of pilasters crowned by a pediment. It is here that we see the name of the patron (Giovanni Ruccelai) in huge Roman capitals. Between the two stories he inserted a mezzanine that serves as an attic for one floor and a base for the other. Alberti framed the second-story temple on either side by large volutes, an ingenious solution to a problem that had perplexed designers of basilica façades for a millennium: how to unite a narrow upper story with a wider lower story and at the same time mask the sloping roofs of the side aisles.When Alberti received this commission, he apparently had to keep two Gothic elements: the side portals of an earlier design and six pointed-arched tomb niches, three to either side of the main door, He absorbed these into his Renaissance design by enclosing the niches within a round-arched blind arcade and by repeating their horizontal green-and-white banding in the pilasters on both levels.
./images/207.jpg	ALBERTI, Leon Battista	Photo	The very large church of the Santa Maria Novella was the first important and independent church in truly Italian style. Its construction began in about 1246 for the Dominican Order. The exact dates of the various parts of the church are still controversial but it certainly took a very long time to build it. The nave was not begun until 1279, and the façade, began in 1310, was not finished until 1470. Nevertheless, the interior and the plan make it the most important church of its date.

./images/209.jpg	ALBERTI, Leon Battista	Photo	The many Roman buildings derived from Alberti's innovations create a link between Alberti and the more grandiose Rome of the High Renaissance and the Baroque. Interestingly enough, none of the architects of these Roman buildings has been securely identified. The courtyard of the Palazzo Venezia in Rome, built after 1455, at a time when Alberti was still connected with the papal court, imitates the arcades and engaged columns of such nearby Roman buildings as the Colosseum and the Theater of Marcellus.This courtyard was designed by an architect from Alberti's circle.
./images/210.jpg	ALBERTI, Leon Battista	Photo	The façade of the Palazzo Ruccelai is a strikingly original contribution to the history of Renaissance palace design. The façade's general principles were followed in many other buildings, some actually built, others merely designed. The basic elements are a rusticated three-story building with an entrance portal and high, square windows on the ground floor, mullioned windows on the second and third, and a massive cornice. The three stories are of equal height, and the rustication is identical in all three stories.According to ancient Roman practice, Ionic was placed above Doric, and Corinthian above Ionic, thus the ground story of Palazzo Ruccelai is Doric (or Tuscan) and the third Corinthian. The second story displays graceful capitals of Alberti's invention composed of acanthus leaves grouped about a central palmette, a fitting intermediate stage between Doric and Corinthian.The palace belonged to a wealthy Florentine merchant, Giovanni Ruccelai.

./images/214.jpg	ALBERTI, Leon Battista	Bronze	Alberti's first appearance in Florence was in 1434, the year of Cosimo de' Medici's return from exile. It was apparently during his time in Florence that Alberti executed a large self-portrait medal in bronze. He shows himself in strict profile, wearing a classical cloak, as indicated by the knot, and a severe haircut based on classical models. Alberti was clearly in the vanguard of artistic developments, for this is one of the earliest, if not the earliest, of Renaissance portrait medals, and also the first independent self-portrait by a Renaissance artist and the first to show the artist dressed in the antique style.The winged eye to the left is Alberti's emblem; the L. Bap. to the right, which is framed by two smaller eyes, refers to his name.

This includes the notable tempietto del Santo Sepolcro (Small temple of the Holy Sepulchre, inspired by the church of the same name in Jerusalem), also by Alberti, covered by polychrome marbles and tarsias.

./images/218.jpg	ALBERTI, Leon Battista	Photo	In 1450 Alberti was given an opportunity to put his classical ideas into visible form in an ambitious structure, the San Francesco in Rimini, called Tempio Malatestiano, that, although unfinished, is known today through amedal by Matteo de' Pasti.In its curvilinear silhouette the façade has no parallel in either Florence or Rome and in this respect is sometimes regarded as an innovation. However, medieval façades of similar shape are in fact relatively common in North Italy, where Alberti had spent his youth. In the precise arrangement of the lower storey, with arches on piers, applied half-columns and roundels in the spandrels, the design is directly dependent on the nearby ancient Arch of Augustus, thus establishing a parallel between antiquity in Rimini and its revival there under Sigismondo Malatesta. Its triumphal associations are presumably deliberate and would refer both to the Christian idea of life triumphant over death and to the Classical idea of fame triumphant over oblivion. The arcaded system of the façade is continued along the sides of the building, although without the half-column articulation. This difference establishes an appropriate architectural distinction between façade and side elevation.View theaxonometric drawingof the planned Tempio Malatestiano, Rimini.

./images/220.jpg	ALBERTINELLI, Mariotto	Panel	This is an early work of the artist. Featuring the Virgin adoring the Child with the help of an angel who hands him some of the instruments of the Passion, it is formally rather weak in its awkward spatial and figural relationships.
./images/221.jpg	ALBERTINELLI, Mariotto	Tempera on panel	The Virgin and Child are represented beside a window with a landscape beyond. The landscape shown through the window at right is painted with a remarkable looseness. The trees, some fine and long limbed, others made full with layered rows of browning leaves, are reminiscent of those in the background ofFra Bartolomeo's Noli Me Tangerein the Louvre. Albertinelli and Fra Bartolomeo set up a workshop in the 1490s. They appear to have been close friends and the two operated under an equal partnership.

./images/223.jpg	ALBERTINELLI, Mariotto	Oil on wood	Mariotto Albertinelli, the pupil of Cosimo Rosselli, ran a workshop with Fra Bartolomeo, and like him shared an interest in the painting of Perugino, whose illuminating example is apparent in this work, unanimously considered to be his masterpiece. However, we cannot fail to notice also the monumentality of the figures and the geometrically divided landscape, influences, these, of Fra Bartolomeo. The spatial breadth is still characteristic of Perugino, but the narrative content is more vigorous.

The small, full figures are firmly and vigorously placed in scenes which respect the most rigorous perspective laws of the Florentine Quattrocento.

./images/227.jpg	ALBERTINELLI, Mariotto	Oil on panel	This signed and dated painting is an autograph variant of Albertinelli' most celebrated work, the Visitation in the Uffizi, Florence, which is dated 1503 but not signed. Just five years after executing the Uffizi prototype, which shows the undeniable influence of Perugino in its use of soft highlights and its inclusion of a classical arcade, the artist returned to the subject using the same cartoon but introduced some fundamental differences to the design: the architectural niche and the landscape have been removed and two additional figures have been introduced. While the central figures may wear robes different in colour and detail from the prototype, they are very much faithful to the original in their harmonious pyramidal design which balances both movement and stasis. Interestingly, the face of Elizabeth in the present work is no longer in shadow as it is in the Uffizi version.The lateral figures may be the work of Giuliano Bugiardini, who is known to have rented quarters next to Albertinelli in 1503 and began assisting him shortly thereafter.

Eighteen volumes containing over 2.900 of Aldrovandi's watercolours show both how wide-ranging his interest was and how precise his observations were in cataloguing the specimens that were kept in his natural history ""museum"" and in the University's botanical garden, founded in 1587. His drawings are instructive as a measure of the perceived possibility that one could, indeed, catalogue nature completely, one specimen at a time piling up in endless sheaves of drawings.The picture shows a page from a volume of drawings."

./images/252.jpg	ALGARDI, Alessandro	Marble	Algardi's portrait busts are much less flamboyant or self-consciously artistic in character than those of Bernini. Where Bernini sought movement and engagement in his portraits, Algardi's approach was more understated, and more concerned with evoking presence through minute attention to physiognomy. His busts seem more aloof because they functioned generally as part of funerary monuments where meditation and piety were the primary requirements.The hallmarks of his approach to portraiture were established by the mid-1630s, when he created the bust of the papal advocate, Monsignor Antonio Cerri, and the posthumous portrait of Cardinal Giovanni Garzia Mellini.The bust of Cerri is an example of the sculptor at his most skillful, moving from the precisely defined modelling of the head and crisply carved folds of collar and drapery to the passages of hair and skin which appear to have issued from a brush rather than a chisel. The downward turn of the head indicates that the bust was once intended to be seen from Cerri's wall monument, but in the event the original was kept back and an inferior copy from Algardi's shop was placed on the tomb.

The work was much admired in Algardi's day, and the critic Bellori praised the illusion of the deceased 'almost kneeling, in the act of praying to the altar'. The bust conveys a sense of Baroque piety and an assured technique: the lace appearing at the Cardinal's sleeves and the short cape carelessly folded behind his left hand are brilliantly observed, and such details contribute to the uncanny sense of a physical presence in the niche.

./images/265.jpg	ALGARDI, Alessandro	Marble	The combination of minute attention to detail and miraculous tonal control are the most engrossing feature of Algardi's busts. When the need arose, he cold also produce a striking performance, as in the splendidly imposing bust of Donna Olimpia Maidalchini, one of the greatest portraits of the period. Disagreeable and domineering, Donna Olimpia did not exude charm, but as the sister-in-law of Pope Innocent X she was a power in Rome during his reign. Algardi transmutes his unpromising sitter into an image of majesty and determination, the tilt of her head and the expression of her face being amplified by a billowing veil. Unusually, Algardi reverses the normal approach to flesh and drapery tones by giving the latter a bright, milky sheen and leaving the former matt. This transposition was dictated by Algardi's emphasis upon the veil which is so integral to the bust's impact.

This appealed to Madame Du Barry, who obtained the Venus and placed it at Louveciennes, and commissioned in 1772 from the sculptor a pendant of virtually the same subject in less languorous mood: a Diana surprised by Actaeon (also in the Louvre, Paris), completed five years later and then exhibited in the artist's studio.

But the strongest influence on Allegrain came from Poussin.
./images/286.jpg	ALLEGRAIN, Etienne	Oil on canvas 	In the last decades of the seventeenth century the ideal landscape of Claude Lorrain was continued by painters such as Étienne Allegrain and Pierre-Antoine Patel (Patel the Younger) who added to it a new type of artificiality which was almost eighteenth-century in character.
./images/287.jpg	ALLORI, Alessandro	Fresco	The twenty-five-year old Ottaviano de' Medici, on behalf of Cardinal Giulio de' Medici and his cousin Pope Leo X, commissioned Andrea del Sarto, Franciabigio and Pontormo for decorations celebrating the pope's father, Lorenzo the Magnificent, and other family members inside the family's villa at Poggio a Caiano. The iconographical programme, designed by the historian Paolo Giovio, aimed to evoke the celebrations of the Medici house through a series of episodes drawn from Roman history.Work in the Salone was halted with the death of Leo X in December 1521. Pontormo was the only one to have finished his lunette fresco, frescoes by Franciabigio and Andrea del Sarto on the long walls were partially incomplete. The decoration was completed by Alessandro Allori in 1578-82, a commission of Grand Duke Francesco de' Medici.Allori first completed the existing parts of the frescoes by Franciabigio and Andrea del Sarto together with those he planned, then he painted two large scenes, The Banquet of Syphax on the long wall containing Franciabigio's The Return of Cicero to Rome, and Titus Quinctius Flamininus's Speech before the Achaeans on the long wall containing Andrea del Sarto's Triumph of Caesar. In both scenes Allori placed the events in a large columned hall that opens up onto a landscape.Finally, he painted the lunette on the wall opposite to Pontormo's lunette. It is a formal pendant to Pontormo's work, he took over the horizontal articulation, the number of figures, even the colours of their garments. The theme of the lunette is Hercules and Fortuna beneath the Tree of the Hesperides.The picture shows the long wall with Allori's The Banquet of Syphax and Franciabigio's The Return of Cicero to Rome, as well as the wall with Pontormo's lunette.

./images/289.jpg	ALLORI, Alessandro	Fresco	Allori's The Banquet of Syphax is located on the long wall of the Salone containing Franciabigio's The Return of Cicero to Rome. Allori placed the event in a large columned hall that opens up onto a landscape. He perhaps found his inspiration in Venetian painting, in particular, Paolo Veronese's depictions of banquets.Syphax was a king of the ancient Numidian tribe Masaesyli of western Numidia during the last quarter of the 3rd century BC. His story is told in Livy's Ab Urbe Condita (written c. 27-25 BC). In his twenty-eighth book Livy records that Scipio, coming from Carthage, was surprised to encounter Hasdrubal, who had retreated from Spain before the Romans, at the court of the Numidian prince Syphax. Their host was flattered that both combatants had sought his support. He invited Scipio and Hasdrubal to share a meal, where the scene that Allori depicted took place. The two bitter enemies  took their meal on the same triclinium.
./images/290.jpg	ALLORI, Alessandro	Fresco	Allori's Titus Quinctius Flamininus's Speech before the Achaeans is located on the long wall containing Andrea del Sarto's Triumph of Caesar. Allori placed the event in a large columned hall that opens up onto a landscape.Titus Quinctius Flamininus (c. 229 BC-c. 174 BC) was a Roman politician and general instrumental in the Roman conquest of Greece. This historical scene shows us Titus Quinctius Flamininus, the victor at Cynoscephalae at a meeting with the Achaeans in Aigon in 192 BC, where he so convinced the Achaeans with his speech that they decided to consider the enemies of Rome as their own enemies as well and declare war against them. This is an analogy to Lorenzo de' Medici's appearance at the Congress of Cremona in February 1483, where he once again demonstrated his powers of persuasion on the stated fighting Venice in the Ferrarese War (1482–84).

./images/295.jpg	ALLORI, Alessandro	Oil on copper	"In this painting the angels are dressing the dead Jesus. The subject is Byzantine in origin and rare in Western art. The mattress, covered with red velvet is a stylized variant of the ""red-stone"" relic, formerly in the Byzantine Pantokrator church. According to an apocryphal legend, Christ was lying on this stone when the angels anointed him and covered him with the shroud. The legendary event, shown on the small painting on copper, is supplemented with a liturgical reference: on the altar in the background, we can see a chalice, symbolizing the mystery of the Eucharist.Alessandro Allori works with definite contours, models like a sculptor and paints numerous small details.The painting is signed in the centre of the altar-step: ALESSANDRO BRONZINO ALLORI FACEVA."
./images/296.jpg	ALLORI, Alessandro	Oil on canvas	It is not easy matter to identify the beautiful, golden-haired Florentine woman wreathed with flowers like Flora or Spring as the Christian Church, or the boy with the languishing satiated look as Christ, betrothing himself to her and rejecting the Synagogue. In the interpretation of Allori, a late Mannerist, the pious subject acquired a strong character of courtly romance.
./images/297.jpg	ALLORI, Alessandro	Fresco	Pure genre scenes like the view of women hanging clothes to dry or combing their hair in the vault of a loggetta in the Palazzo Pitti are extremely rare in the monumental form of fresco decorations in the sixteenth century. Comparable scenes are, however, regularly found as elements of landscapes or grotesques.This stunning room was originally an open loggia leading on to the Boboli Gardens, and located in the South wing of the Palace. It was designed to house the “Apartments for Foreign Princes and Cardinals” (Guest Apartments). It boasts the oldest painted decoration in Pitti Palace, commissioned from Alessandro Allori by Ferdinand de’ Medici shortly before he became Grand Duke. In the centre of the vault, a trompe l’oeil depicts a terrace that opens out under the sky and, along the balustrade, various female figures as they perform everyday activities. The highly naturalistic elegance with which animals and some items – such as the candelabras filled with numberless species of flowers – are shown, together with the sheer quality of the execution make this ceiling one of the most extraordinary examples of Florentine Mannerist painting in a private setting. In the centre of the vault, a pair of angels are lifting the Cardinal’s coat-of-arms into the skies, surrounded by a wide variety of birds. Idealised landscapes decorate the walls in an easily narrative style, but also with a wealth of extremely modern naturalistic details, modelled on Flemish experiences, as translated in Florence by Paul Bril. The excellent quality of the frescoes means this work can certainly be attributed to Alessandro Allori, even if some sections are by workshop artists. Restoration work in the 1990s brought to light the illusory decorations that reproduce the balustrade on the outer side of the ancient loggia, as well as the brilliance of the original colours.
./images/298.jpg	ALLORI, Alessandro	Oil on copper	What strikes us in this portrait is the convincing compromise between the formal purity acquired from Bronzino, the predilection for enlarged forms drawn from Michelangelo, and the balanced, rhythmic spatial models of Raphael, for Allori was a truly skilled alchemist in combining these various influences in a dignified way.The lady portrayed is certainly Bianca Cappello, already painted by Allori in a fresco which now hangs in the Tribune of the Uffizi.On the back of the portrait is an allegorical scene, the Dream of Human Life.

./images/300.jpg	ALLORI, Alessandro	Fresco	Grand Duke Francesco I de' Medici was a man of profound and obsessive passions. The Uffizi galleries, which he established, were one, Bianca Cappello (1548-1587), his mistress, and afterwards, the second wife, was the other.
./images/301.jpg	ALLORI, Alessandro	Oil on lead with gold leaf	Francesco I (1541-1587) was the son of Cosimo de' Medici and Eleonora di Toledo and ruled as second Grand Duke of Tuscany from 1574 until his death in 1587. The present small tondo was probably a gift from Francesco to his sister Lucrezia on the occasion of her marriage to the Ferrarese Duke Alfonso II d'Este in June 1588.

At the same time he did many portraits among them that of Tommaso de' Bardi and of his wife Ortensia Montauti.
./images/303.jpg	ALLORI, Alessandro	Oil on canvas transferred from wood	Formerly the painting was attributed to Agnolo Bronzino. The sitter was assumed to be either Grand Duke Cosimo Medici II (1590-1621) or Grand Duke Ferdinando Medici (1551-1609). These assumptions are, however, not proven.
./images/304.jpg	ALLORI, Alessandro	Oil on copper	In a nocturnal scene, John the Baptist preaches the coming of Christ. He holds the standard of the Resurrection above a lamb representing Christ's sacrifice. Allori seems to have looked back to the Mannerist for his palette, to Michelangelo for his figures, and to northern Europe for his landscape.
./images/305.jpg	ALLORI, Alessandro	Oil on copper	In this work, as often occurs in the painting of Allori, the composition is slightly over-emphatic. Saint Peter, kneeling in the foreground, enveloped in his billowing garments, seems in fact to be acting on a stage. The setting, instead, is made pleasant and gracious thanks to an almost archaic use of perspective, to that sea rising high on the horizon, ruffled by light foaming waves, and to the small boat, tossed by the waters, brimming with small figures.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 21 minutes):Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina: Missa Brevis (Tu es Petrus)
./images/306.jpg	ALLORI, Alessandro	Oil on slate	The Studiolo is a tiny chamber in the Palazzo dei Priori (Palazzo Vecchio), accessible by a hidden spiral staircase. It was dedicated to the geological, mineralogical and alchemical interest of Francesco I de' Medici, son and successor of Cosimo I. Its walls are lined with two tiers of oil paintings on slate or panel that act as doors for cupboards containing Francesco's scientific books, specimens, and instruments.Alessandro Allori's contributions to the decoration of the Studiolo in the Palazzo Vecchio included the Pearl Fishers.Allori was the follower of Agnolo Bronzino, and his style imitates the cool, smooth manner of his teacher. Exquisite male and female nudes, human and mythological, play about on rocks, dive off boats, and bring up shells overflowing with seawater and pearls. Over and over the figures quote Michelangelo (the central nude seen from the back comes straight out of theBattle of Cascina), but only in the most playful way. The echoes of theDeluge on the Sistine Ceilingare transformed by Allori's predominantly pink and blue colouring.

./images/308.jpg	ALLORI, Alessandro	Fresco	The Vasari Corridor was built in 1564 by Giorgio Vasari in only five months at the time of the wedding between Francesco I de' Medici and Giovanna of Austria; it served to link up the Pitti Palace, where the Grand Duke resided, with the Uffizi (or offices) where he worked.It is a covered walk, almost a kilometre in length, an overhead passageway that starts out from the West Corridor of the Gallery, heads towards the Arno and then, raised up by huge arches, follows the river as far as the Ponte Vecchio, which it crosses by passing on top of the shops. On the other side of the Arno, the corridor passes through the interior of the church of Santa Felicità, and finally reaches the Boboli gardens and the apartments in the Pitti Palace.This detail of the decoration of the corridor represents mixed beings (hybrids) frequently created in the Mannerist period by painters of grotesques. They are part of the decoration of the made by Alessandro Allori and his workshop.

./images/311.jpg	ALLORI, Cristofano	Oil on canvas	Judith with the Head of Holofernes has been described as the most celebrated of all Florentine seicento pictures. It exists in numerous versions, the best known being that in the Palazzo Pitti, Florence, painted for Grand Duke Cosimo II. The primacy of the version in the Royal Collection, however, depends principally on the vividness of the characterisation, the freshness of colouring, and the numerous changes effected during the course of painting even after several preparatory drawings had been made. Many of these changes are visible to the naked eye and accord with early descriptions of Allori's working methods. By contrast, the version in the Palazzo Pitti is slicker and more self-assured as a result of following an established design.The painting's reputation is derived from the autobiographical aspect of the treatment of the subject as recounted by Filippo Baldinucci (1625-96) in his Notizie de' professori del disegno da Cimabue in qua. Baldinucci records that Allori was essentially a libertine who was given to occasional bouts of piety. Regarding the subject of the present picture he states that the figure of Judith is a portrait of the painters lover, Maria di Giovanni Mazzafirri (died 1617), known as 'La Mazzafirra' that the features of the servant are those of La Mazzafirra's mother, and that the head of the decapitated Holofernes is a self-portrait of the artist. In essence, the composition commemorates an unhappy liaison and symbolises the suffering that Allori experienced at the hands of La Mazzafirra.The story of the Jewish heroine Judith, who saves her townspeople the Bethulians by cutting off the head of the Assyrian general Holofernes, is recorded in the Book of Judith found in The Apocrypha. The subject was frequently represented, sometimes as a straightforward narrative, sometimes with an allegorical (usually political) significance. The double meaning in the painting by Allori is confirmed by a poem by Giovanbattista Marino (La Galena, 1619), written in Paris where he saw one of the versions. Marino writes that Holofernes is killed twice, firstly by Cupid's darts and secondly by the sword. It is a theme that continues in literature certainly up to John Keats's La Belle Dame sans Merci. The female artists Lavinia Fontana and Artemisia Gentileschi depicted themselves as Judith, and there is an autobiographical element in the Judith by Jacopo Ligozzi of 1602 (Florence, Palazzo Pitti). Similar opportunities arose in the treatment of the subjects of David and Salome. Caravaggio, for instance, in the David and Goliath dating from 1605-06 (Rome, Galleria Borghese), used his own features for the head of Goliath. This last is a composition that Allori knew.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 17 minutes):Alessandro Scarlatti: La Giuditta, oratorio, Part I (excerpts)
./images/312.jpg	ALLORI, Cristofano	Oil on canvas	"Cristofano Allori trained in the school of his father and his grandfather, the leading Florentine Mannerist Agnolo Allori, known as Bronzino. Even if Cristofano may be regarded as an artist who broke with late Mannerist tendencies and went on to become an express proponent of early Baroque reform ideas, he nevertheless continues to borrow certain traits of ""Mannerist physiognomy"" in order to heighten the effect of a picture. In his most famous painting, Judith with the Head of Holofernes, the extreme contrast between the dark and bearded head of Holofernes and the angelic face of his murderess owes much to the Mannerist school in which he was trained.Allori is said to have created a portrait of his mistress Mazzafirra in the figure of Judith and her mother in the figure of the elderly servant woman. The head of Holofernes may be a self-portrait. If this is true, the picture would certainly be a classic example of the so-called ""portrait historié"" in which real figures are presented as figures from history. Whether or not this is true, the significance of this painting lies predominantly in the enormous erotic tension that emanates not only from the faces of Judith and Holofernes, but also from the sensuality with which the Old Testament heroine is portrayed. This major theme of triumph over tyranny had never before been presented from this point of view.This is the only painting from the long neglected Florentine school of the seventeenth century whose reputation has always remained at the highest level, and it therefore gained a sort of symbolic value. Moreover, its fame as a masterpiece of the Seicento spread beyond regional borders, thanks in part to its temporary confiscation and subsequent display in the Musée Napoléon in Paris between 1799 and 1815. The work is by far the best of the many existing versions, copies, and derivations. Although it is not the prime version of this much-painted composition, it is possibly the only fully autograph surviving example.Allori, a Florentine, painted this canvas during Artemisia Gentileschi's stay in Florence, and surelyknew her version.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 17 minutes):Alessandro Scarlatti: La Giuditta, oratorio, Part I (excerpts)"
./images/313.jpg	ALLORI, Cristofano	Oil on canvas	The most famous painting by Florentine artist Cristofano Allori, carried out between 1610 and 1612, became an instant success and was widely copied, due in part to the popularity of the legend of the biblical heroine Judith which the artist interpreted autobiographically; the decapitated head of Holofernes is a self-portrait while his lover Mazzafirra is portrayed in the beautiful face of the young woman, whose extraordinarily luxurious clothing is a direct tribute to the city's thriving textile industry.This work by Cristofano acknowledges his influence from Caravaggio through the teachings of Artemisia Gentileschi who, in the same period in the service of the Medici family, painted two violent interpretations of Judith for Cosimo II. Cristofano emphasizes the heroine's beauty, the candour of her skin tones and the exquisite quality of her clothing, contrasted against the horror of the decapitated head she holds in her hand. Judith appears proud of her deed and sure of her divine protection.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 17 minutes):Alessandro Scarlatti: La Giuditta, oratorio, Part I (excerpts)

The principal Spanish exponent of this style was the sculptor Sebastián de Almonacid, whose name first appears in 1486. He is the author of the double tomb of the Constable Alvaro de Luna and his wife in Toledo cathedral, and is thought to have carved the tomb of Martin Vázquez de Arce in Sigüenza cathedral. The idealized realism of the effigy is one of the supreme achievements of Spanish plastic art.

./images/324.jpg	ALSLOOT, Denis van	Oil on copper	Cephalus and Procris were in Greek mythology a young couple, newly married, whose love was destined to end in tragedy. The figures in the painting are probably by another hand most likely to be Alsloot's principle collaborator, Henderick de Clerck.
./images/325.jpg	ALSLOOT, Denis van	Oil on oak panel	The forested landscapes of Alsloot often incorporate views of castles and abbeys located in the Foret de Soignes, near Brussels, a frequent source of inspiration. The building depicted with topographical accuracy in its lakeside setting in the present painting can be identified as the château at Tervueren, an important site tied to the Brussels court.As in many of Alsloot's paintings the figures are probably the work of Alsloot's principal collaborator, Hendrik de Clerck.
./images/326.jpg	ALSLOOT, Denis van	Oil on panel	From the late fifteenth century the landscape genre had a great development in Flanders. In many cases landscapes of the period not only showed the nature that surrounded the artists but also the population, both peasants and the upper classes, performing different activities. The snowy landscape, a typical Flemish genre, showed the people in their outdoor activities despite the cold. The scenes of skaters and carnivals became associated with this type of snowy landscapes.Denis van Alsloot, painter to the archducal court in Brussels, was a prominent landscape painter. The scene depicted in his Skating during Carnival takes place in Antwerp, identified by the walls built with Charles V and the Church of St. Jacques. What we see is a social scene where the characters perform different activities, highlighting the skaters with colourful carnival costumes. The clothing of most of the characters indicates that this is the entertainment of the upper classes. Many of the clothes that the characters wear come from Spanish fashion, but there are also some typical Flemish garments.

./images/330.jpg	ALTDORFER, Albrecht	Panel	A family of satyrs has settled on a tree-covered slope at the foot of a cliff. The man with horns and goat's feet is shown holding a club, while a blonde woman nestles against him and supports the child standing on her thigh. The couple seem to be oblivious of a scene taking place in a nearby meadow, where a woman in a red dress is attempting to flee from a naked man who is carrying a stick in one hand and holding her fast with the other.The uninhibited way of life of human or semi-human beings in the freedom of natural surroundings was a frequently occurring theme in literary and pictorial works of the Renaissance, following the precedent of antiquity. German artists became familiar with subjects of this kind mainly through copper-engravings by Andrea Mantegna and other northern Italian artists. By no means all these themes were derived straight from antiquity; frequently they were mythological fantasies inspired by Roman relief sculpture.The whole atmosphere of Altdorfer's idyllic scene suggests that it was inspired not so much by engravings as by the Arcadian landscapes of Venetian painters of the school of Giorgione; yet, although the motif of the naked woman seen from behind seems to confirm this, Altdorfer's approach to his art is fundamentally different. The satisfaction of depicting the nude, for which scenes from antiquity provided the most obvious pretext, is entirely subordinate in Altdorfer's paintings to his rendering of nature. The figures, which are fairly summarily treated, remain small and relatively inconspicuous against the dense wooded background. Whether the painter actually visited Venice is not certain but it does seem highly likely. About 1500 he was working in the Salzburg region at the Mondsee monastery, before he acquired burgher's rights in Regensburg in 1505. The present work, produced two years later, is one of Altdorfer's earliest signed and dated paintings. Like Cranach's Rest on the Flight, painted in 1504, it points the way to a new awareness of landscape in the Renaissance period, originally stemming from the so-called Danube school.Around the middle of the last century this portrait was in the Kraenner Collection in Regensburg; it later passed into the collection of Barthel Suermondt, which was purchased for the Berlin Gallery in 1874.

./images/332.jpg	ALTDORFER, Albrecht	Parchment on wood	With a sentimental note and an intuitive science of light and colouring, the masters of the Danube school, Altdorfer and Huber, gave free rein to their lyricism in scintillating mythologies and religious scenes, in which the landscape acquires an importance never before equalled, and vibrates with a completely personal communion with nature.Altdorfer became a citizen of Regensburg in 1505, and later the Surveyor of the city's buildings. The steeply wooded stretch of the Danube below the city, with the castle of Worth, appears in several Altdorfer paintings.
./images/333.jpg	ALTDORFER, Albrecht	Wood	Altdorfer placed biblical and historical scenes into German landscapes, and the figures were represented in contemporary dresses. As an exampée, this well-known biblical scene takes place in the garden of a Renaissance palace.
./images/334.jpg	ALTDORFER, Albrecht	Oil tempera on wood	This is the most famous painting of Altdorfer. Its subject is the victory of the young Alexander the Great in 333 B.C. over the Persian army of King Darius in the battle of Issos. The battle in fact took place in Turkey, however, on this painting it is shown in the rocky environment of the Alps with German cities in the background.The viewer, endowed with telescopic vision, witnesses the battle and the cosmic landscape. The ebb and flow of battle makes it difficult initially to distinguish the two sides. Altdorfer dressed the Macedonians like German knights and landsknechts (mercenary foot-soldiers), while the Persian warriors sport turbans and exotic attires. Hundreds of riders and foot-soldiers skirmish within sight of their battle standards. Darius' chariot, with mounted steel blades, cuts a path through the throng. Alexander, riding on Bucephalus, and some of his knights are in close pursuit. Darius escaped but at great cost: according to the tablet above, 100.000 Persian soldiers and 10.000 riders died. Although the actual toll was lower, Darius' army was decimated and his family was captured.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 12 minutes):Heinrich Ignaz Franz von Biber: The Battle, suite

./images/338.jpg	ALTDORFER, Albrecht	Oil on limewood	Albrecht Altdorfer was one of the great German masters of the 16th century. Although remaining within the orbit of Dürer's influence, Altdorfer began a trend in painting which focused on the representation of nature, which he interpreted - in an almost Romantic style - as something living and moving. This development became known as the Danube school and Altdorfer was its principal representative.
./images/339.jpg	ALTDORFER, Albrecht	Linden panel	The small diptych represents the Stigmatisation of St Francis (left panel) and the Penitence of St Jerome (right panel). In the diptych the two saints are seen close-up, in contrast with the infinite space of their landscape settings.Altdorfer belongs to a small group of German artists for whom landscape assumed great importance, both for helping to set the emotional tone of a narrative scene, and for its own sake.
./images/340.jpg	ALTDORFER, Albrecht	Parchment on lime panel	Altdorfer was one of Germany's most innovative artists in an era spanning late medieval piety, the Renaissance and the Reformation, and his work reveals many facets of a changing society. It is especially noteworthy for an expressive use of nature and for introducing landscape as a theme of its own in art. In this respect Altdorfer is the central figure of the Danube school.The forest was the outdoor setting most favoured by Altdorfer, and it sets the tone of many subjects both secular and religious.
./images/341.jpg	ALTDORFER, Albrecht	Oil on panel	The Virgin is shown resting in a throne-like chair by a richly ornate Renaissance fountain, while Joseph proffers a basket of cherries. Several angels are playing in and around the basin of the fountain, and the child Jesus tries to reach into the water. The fountain-pillar is lavishly decorated with sculpture. The significance of the group of figures at the top - a bearded man with a boy shooting an arrow - is not clear, but appears to relate to ancient mythology. Beyond the fountain the wooded shores of a lake stretch far into the distance. The rocks are crowded with gateways, fortified roads and towers, houses with pointed gables, ruins and decaying roofs - all so intricately interwoven with trees and foliage that it is difficult to detect the relationship of any one building to the other.The element of fantasy, which so dominates the landscape, is also apparent in the fountain, in which the figures seem to be drawn both from reality and from the artist's imagination. There is no prototype or parallel in Altdorfer's time for the bizarre appearance of the fountain. The painter's artistic invention was sin this case at least a generation ahead of his time.At the foot of the fountain is a stone tablet bearing the Latin inscription: 'Albertus Aldorfer pictor Ratisponensis in salutem animae hoc tibi munus diva maria sacravit corde fideli 1510 AA' ('Albrecht Altdorfer, painter from Regensburg, for the salvation of his soul dedicated this gift to thee, divine Mary, with a faithful heart');.this indicates a very personal confession on the part of the painter, his appeal to the Virgin Mary. The dedication must also be taken as an explanation of the central feature of the picture, the fountain, which - though symbolic of a heathen place - is nonetheless the water of life for the Holy Family. The motif recalls the legend, according to which a spring appeared from the earth when the Holy Family in its flight sought a place to rest. A few years earlier Cranach had treated the same theme;this fact establishes a singular bond between the two paintings.It is assumed that the landscape reproduces impressions from the country near Regensburg, and in particular the hamlets of Scheuchenberg, Lerchenhaube and Wörth, which are also recognizable in Altdorfer's Crucifixion in the gallery at Cassel. The painter settled in Regensburg in 1505 and twenty years later was appointed the city's master-builder. Most of his pictures point to a predilection for architecture and architectural décor. An example of this is the highly imaginitive construction of the fountain and - on another panel in Berlin painted somewhat later - the ruin in the darkness which serves as the setting for the birth of Christ.

./images/343.jpg	ALTDORFER, Albrecht	Linden panel	Staged as a nocturne, this Nativity takes place in a stable so ruinous that an additional miracle may be found in its not having collapsed upon the Holy Family sheltering within. The stable clearly enjoyed a loftier function before housing ox, ass, and homeless family, probably first built in Bethlehem as part of the palace of David, ancestor of the Virgin.

At the foot of the cross, where in other such works one finds the skull of Adam, said to have been buried at Golgotha and whose sins Christ atones for by his death, is their coat of arms, with a hexagram. On either side of Christ, who is represented not in an idealised manner but with the signs of his injuries, the landscape stretches away into the far distance.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 3 minutes):Guillaume Dufay: Hymn for Easter
./images/347.jpg	ALTDORFER, Albrecht	Limewood	The picture shows a detail of the landscape behind the cross. Altdorfer is considered to be one of the founders of the German landscape painting that emerges in the early 16th century, the great achievement of which is the representation of nature in its concrete reality, essential for the later development of art.
./images/348.jpg	ALTDORFER, Albrecht	Wood	Apart from Dürer, Cranach and Grünewald, Altdorfer was the most significant German artist of the sixteenth century: a gifted painter, a graphic artist and the founder of the Danube School. He worked in Regensburg on the Danube, painting altarpieces and Biblical and historical scenes, and he was also the first landscape painter in the modern sense.The Crucifixion is a composition with numerous figures depicted against a golden background. This works illustrates very fully his fresh manner of representation and narration. Altdorfer painted several Crucifixions, but it is possible, on stylistic grounds, to date this version to around 1520. The symmetrical arrangement, with the cross in the centre of the composition, the crowd surging round it and the golden background (an unusual feature with Altdorfer) give the work a peculiarly archaic character. As in some of his engravings, the painter borrowed several of the figures and motifs from Mantegna.The painting was commissioned by Peter Maurer, Provost of Sankt Florian for his private chapel. It is signed with the artist's monogram at bottom right.

./images/355.jpg	ALTDORFER, Albrecht	Oil on panel	Very few portraits by Altdorfer are known. In this painting the image of the woman is a strange one, despite the apparent normality of the sitter, who has the air of a countrywoman. The cold light which illuminates her and the contrast with the background, with its sketchy and barely decipherable shadows, contribute to this mood.
./images/356.jpg	ALTDORFER, Albrecht	Oil on wood	One of Altdorfer's most ambitious commissions involved the execution of panels for the altarpiece in the Collegiate Church of Saint Florian near Linz, which was installed in 1518. Originally the ornate shrine must have resembled the greataltarpiece of Saint Wolfgangby Michael Pacher, with an elaborate framework intricately carved about painted panels, and inner sculptures, but only the paintings remain intact. Now dismantled, most parts are at either Sankt Florian or Vienna.When the wings are opened, eight episodes from the Passion of Christ appear in two registers; closed, four scenes in the life of Saint Sebastian are presented. The predella displays four more painted panels, including the Entombment and Resurrection, Saints Margaret and Barbara, and the donor, Provost Peter Maurer. Altdorfer's drama of the Passion is intensified in emotion and superbly composed with four scenes that takes place in the darkness and four opposing scenes on the right, which occur in daylight.The first of the series, Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane, is one of the finest examples of the artist's expression in themes of betrayal and violence. The threatening darkness of the night sky, striated by intense layers of red, does not conceal the nature of the sinister landscape of Gethsemane. In the foreground an eerie grotto of stalactites forms the uneasy stage for Christ and his three apostles, Peter, James, and John.
./images/357.jpg	ALTDORFER, Albrecht	Oil on wood	"One of the main concerns of the German artist Albrecht Altdorfer was to paint atmospheric landscapes. In the Arrest scene of the St Florian Altarpiece, which today survives only in fragments, the light from the torches throws up a night scene in a forest covered by a somberly glowing night sky. This kind of dramatic interpretation of the subject matter was just the sort of model Holbein needed for his Passion altarpiece.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 11 minutes):Georges de la Hele: Missa ""Nigra sum"""

They are not belong to the St Florian Altarpiece executed by Altdorfer for the abbey church in Sankt Florian near Linz, Austria. It is not known whether this altarpiece was also painted for the same church.Albrecht Altdorfer was a painter who tended to specialize in landscape and architecture to such an extent that these elements, from being simple background decorations, often became the central theme of his paintings. The dramatic and enchanted images that were the hallmark of his style caused him to be considered one of the precursors of Romanticism.Altdorfer's fantastic, visionary art represented the other side of sixteenth century culture. In his paintings he borrows the extremely vivid colours from dreams, the narration becomes impassioned, and the space-time elements narrow and expand irrationally.Particularly noteworthy is the crystalline clearness of the colours, especially the whites, which contribute to giving the story and the whole scene a somewhat unreal atmosphere.

Passers-be recovered his body which was watched over by an eagle until taken away for burial. He was said to have miraculously put out the flames of a burning building, or a whole city, with a single bucket of water. He is thus invoked against fire. He is a popular saint in Austria and Bavaria.
./images/363.jpg	ALTDORFER, Albrecht	Woodcut with five tone blocks	The Beautiful (or Fair) Virgin of Regensburg was a thirteenth century Byzantine icon of the Virgin and Child, believed to have been painted by St Luke. Many miracles (74 were documented in 1519 and 731 in 1522) were credited to this icon and hundreds of thousands of pilgrims from Bavaria, Franconia and Bohemia came to Regensburg.Albrecht Altdorfer, then member of the city council, designed tokens sold to the pilgrims and at least four different prints of the Beautiful Virgin. The finest, most expensive of these was a chiaroscuro woodcut, which in is first edition was printed with tone blocks in blue, red, green, brown, and yellow-brown. The icon is set within an elaborate Renaissance-style frame. The accompanying prayer reads, 'You are of perfect beauty my love and there is no blemish in you. Hail Mary.' Regensburg coat-of-arms and Altdorfer's monogram appear to either side.
./images/364.jpg	ALTDORFER, Albrecht	Etching	Landscape was an interest of German artists of the beginning of 16th century. Lucas Cranach and Albrecht Altdorfer had discovered the beauty of the Alpine districts around the Danube and developed a kind of romantic landscape painting and etching, often enlivened by dramatic effects of light. An interest in dramatic nocturnal scenes is also apparent in the works of Dürer's follower, Hans Baldung Grien.
./images/365.jpg	ALTDORFER, Albrecht	Etching with watercolour	Painters of theDanube schoolmade landscapes a central feature of their works. Landscape became valued for its own sake. Figures and narrative content are often absent. Most of Altdorfer's landscapes are fantasies rather than records of actual towns or places. In this etching he presented a plausible view of a village by a small river with a well-fortified castle above. Conjuring up memories of the German or Alpine countryside, it is a setting for the imagination's delectation.
./images/366.jpg	ALTDORFER, Albrecht	Woodcut	Like in his paintings, the unity of figure and landscape can also be seen in Altdorfer's woodcuts. Even though the figure of St George thrusts a long lance into the dragon's mouth across the main foreground, he still does not stand out from the mountainous setting. The plumes of his helmet meld into the foliage.

./images/374.jpg	ALTICHIERO da Zevio	Fresco	The Adoration of the Magi is located middle right on the entry wall of the chapel.Altichiero always gave his figures space, in the sense of room to move, along with this freedom of movement are their characteristic serenity and deliberate quality, which is strongly reminiscent of Giotto's figural ideal. A good example of this is the Adoration of the Magi, in which one can clearly see how Altichiero has combined the Giottesque character of the figures with the penchant for narrative detail that is more in tune with the taste of his own time. He does this by directing the attention of the viewer to the retinue of people from the Orient, to the humble appearance of the stable, and to the clothing, with its often contemporary, ultrafashionable cut and high-quality materials. Furthermore, in order to denote the specific locality, the painter allows the walls and towers of Bethlehem to rise beyond the mountains.

./images/376.jpg	ALTICHIERO da Zevio	Fresco	The Crucifixion scene is located on the altar wall. The grouping and the gestures of the figures are characterized by a particularly high level of sophistication. In the distinct contrast between the serene pose and inward-focused expression of the crucified Christ, on the one hand, and the agitation of the mourning angels on the other, we still feel the influence of theCrucifixion fresco in the Scrovegni Chapel,though the added thieves and crowd gathered below the crosses conform to the archetype of the densely populated paintings of Golgotha that in the meantime had become common in Trecento painting.
./images/377.jpg	ALTICHIERO da Zevio	Fresco	Six of the seven paintings on the northeast wall (left to the entrance) are devoted to the life and martyrdom of St George. The picture shows St George Baptizes the King and His Family (top) and St George Liberated by Angels from Torture on the Wheel (bottom).According to the Golden Legend, the king had a large church erected in honour of the Virgin Mary and St George. The three-aisle basilica shown in cross section in the middle segment of the baptizing scene's expansive architectural backdrop, with its lofts, galleries, pulpits and all sorts of attached structures, is an allusion to this church.The St George cycle continues in the lower register of the wall with images depicting the saint being sentenced to various tortures. However, neither the cup of poison given to St George nor torture on the sword-studded wheel is capable of doing the condemned saint any harm. Two angels intervene and the wheel breaks into pieces, causing the commander, the torturers, and the onlookers to shrink back in horror.
./images/378.jpg	ALTICHIERO da Zevio	Fresco	Six of the seven paintings on the northeast wall (left to the entrance) are devoted to the life and martyrdom of St George, beginning with St George Slays the Dragon in the upper register of the wall. It is characteristic of Altichiero that he did not limit the scene to the figures of the knight slaying the dragon with his lance and the princess; he added a rocky landscape that stretches deep into space at the left of the image and, as a counterpart to this on the right, included a fantastic image of the city of Silene from whose walls the king and his wife, as well as the inhabitants of the city, follow with frightened looks the battle taking place before the city gate.
./images/379.jpg	ALTICHIERO da Zevio	Fresco	In this scene, most of those present are wearing traditional garb of the period; moreover, several of these figures are presumed to be portraits of contemporaries. Similarities wwith theportrait of Petrarchin a contemporary codex, the man dressed in dark red behind St George can be identified as Petrarch, while the figure beside him on his left may be his secretary and pupil, Lombardo della Seta.
./images/380.jpg	ALTICHIERO da Zevio	Fresco	This scene is located in the lower register of the northeast wall.St George was beheaded before the city gates. This scene is vividly depicted in the last fresco of the northeast wall. Soldiers with their upright spears and lances, officers on horses, and several citizens form a compact wall of people around the saint, who kneels on the ground deep in prayer. Above the saint's lowered head, the executioner raises his sword and is readying himself to deliver the deadly blow.Here Altichiero shows most  interestingly the influence of Giotto in the solidity of his groups of figures posed in large natural spaces. He achieves brilliant results with this technique, softened by Gothic details. In addition to this, the Veronese painter took pains to portray everyday feelings. Notice the way the father takes his son away from the scene of the macabre torture.
./images/381.jpg	ALTICHIERO da Zevio	Fresco	On the southwest wall opposite the St George cycle are four scenes depicting the work and martyrdom of St Catherine (in the upper register) and that of St Lucy (in the lower register). The picture shows the scenes St Catherine Liberated by an Angel from the Torture on the Wheel (top) and The Martyrdom of St Lucy (bottom).The first two pictures, dedicated to St Catherine, are in very poor condition; they show the saint appearing before Emperor Maxentius to condemn idolatry and her dispute with the philosophers summoned by the emperor and their conversion. These scenes are followed by the picture of an angel intervening to prevent Catherine's torture on the wheel and the beheading of the saint. Both scenes have parallels in the St George cycle, here, however, an oriental milieu, seen in the physiognomies, head coverings, and scimitars, is emphasized still more.The first Lucy scene in the lower register shows the steadfastness of the saint before the judge Paschasius, the second and unsuccessful attempt to have her brought to a brothel with a team of oxen. These scenes are followed by the martyrdom of the saint, and the concluding scene is her burial. In the martyrdom scene she survives torture by flame and boiling oil, unscathed, and is then stabbed to death.

Numerous citizens dressed in contemporary garb are present at the funeral ceremony, and some of their faced have unmistakably portrait-like features. This applies particularly to the figures in the left half of the image, among whom Giovanni de' Lupi, the brother of Bonifacio, and Giovanni Dondi, the famous doctor who was an intimate friend of Petrarch, are to be recognized.

./images/385.jpg	ALTICHIERO da Zevio	Fresco	The frescoes in the Cappella di San Giacomo (Chapel of St James) were commissioned by Bonifacio Lupi di Soragno and his wife, Caterina dei Franceschi. The architecture, designed by the Venetian sculptor and architect Andriolo de' Santi was commissioned in 1372. This chapel was begun in 1372 in a privileged location inside the Basilica del Santo opposite the Cappella di Sant'Antonio (Chapel of St Anthony) and was completed, along with its painted decoration, in 1379.The painting school of Padua can be ranked as the most vigorous of the northern Italian schools: the painters of Padua built upon Giotto's achievements. The prolific Paduan fresco painters added striking naturalistic observations of their own in landscape, in the painting of animals, and in portraiture. The most successful painters of the period came to Padua from outside - Jacopo Avanzi from Bologna and Altichiero da Zevio from Verona. In the Chapel of St James, to Avanzi have been attributed most of the lunettes of the Life of St James, painted about 1374, while to Altichiero has been assigned the huge Crucifixion and some of the other lunettes.
./images/386.jpg	ALTICHIERO da Zevio	Fresco	The Veronese painter Altichiero studied Giotto's frescoes in Padua and borrowing from them developed new forms of pictorial architecture. Around 1380, he and Jacopo Avanzo painted a cycle of frescoes in the Chapel of San Giacomo in the Santo (the church of Sant'Antonio) in Padua. The group compositions of his Crucifixion are those of Giotto's figures, but the architecture is structured so that it seems to recede ever deeper into the background of the picture. Only a stone's throw from the chapel, the young Titian was to work in the Scuola del Santo in 1511, where he was deeply impressed by Altichiero's colour scheme and composition.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 3 minutes):Guillaume Dufay: Hymn for Easter
./images/387.jpg	ALTICHIERO da Zevio	Fresco	The Crucifixion above the altar extends across three of the five bays of the Chapel of San Giacomo, functioning as an enormous altarpiece. Although rich in anecdotal detail and portrait-like renderings, the fresco does not include the crosses of the two thieves who were crucified with Christ, concentrating instead on the central sacrifice. The cross is set in the foreground of a broadly coherent space which extends in greater and greater depth as it moves to either side, culminating in a hilltop castle on the far right and a firmly rendered and believably scaled pedestrian bridge, city gate, walls, and towers on the far left.

./images/391.jpg	ALTICHIERO da Zevio	Fresco	Before his stay in Padua, the Veronese painter Altichiero painted frescoes in Verona, including  the votive fresco of the Cavalli family in Sant'Anastasia.Partially ruined by the insertion of a canopied tomb in about 1390, the fresco is the collective votive offering of the Cavalli family from Verona. The men of the family, in armor, are before the Virgin. The family's patron saints accompany the faithful and their nonchalant movements contrast wonderfully with the stiff votive posture of the kneeling knights. The setting is also splendid, showing an imaginary fourteenth-century palace complete with galleries and pavilions.

To mark this visit, a large number of temporary triumphal arches were built, modeled on the monuments created to greet the archducal couple Albert and Isabella to Flanders in 1599. The visit of the Spanish king initiated a vogue for the Flemish Baroque. An example of this is the façade of Nossa Senhora dos Grilos in Porto, started in 1622, which is a creation of Baltasar Álvares.

He places the sitter in an interior, with a window through which we can see a stormy and mountainous landscape painted in soft blue tones, which become blurred as they recede into the background. The sitter is seated and looks out at the viewer, leaning on the edge of a table. The various objects around him refer to his profession. Matthäus Schwarz was accountant to the Fugger family, Germany's leading financiers, and was also the author of number of treatises on economics.

The Divine Institutions (Divinarum Institutionum Libri VII), written between 303 and 311,is the most important of his writings.The bound manuscript contains 207 folios, the frontispiece is on folio 5r and contains a vignette, rectangular in format (100 x 77 mm), showing Lactantius at work in his study. The scene has an airy effect due to the vivid colours - the violet walls, the starry blue vault, and pink-tiled floor. The margins of the folio are adorned with continuous trellis of blue, green, and pink vines, with yellow roses, on a black background. The medallion on the right depicts a struggle between a centaur and a dragon. The initial M is inscribed inside a rectangular picture field with a white vine-leaf pattern.

./images/418.jpg	AMERLING, Friedrich von	Oil on canvas	"Amerling was the favourite court painter and from 1830 one of the most popular artist in Vienna. His reputation was based on the life-size portrait of Emperor Franz in 1832. In this portrait the traditional Baroque attributes of a royal portrait are combined with a depiction of ""natural man"". This is what makes the portrait unconventional.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 11 minutes):Modest Mussorgsky: Boris Godunov, Coronation Scene"
./images/419.jpg	AMERLING, Friedrich von	Oil on canvas	From the early 1830s to approximately 1850 Amerling was Vienna's most celebrated portraitist. A likeness, almost identical to this portrait and entitled Modest Susanna, was executed in 1837.The portrait represents an example of one of Amerling's favourite compositional schemata to position the bare-backed sitter, turned away from the beholder. Effective highlights lend a soft gleam to the young face and betray the influence ofThomas Lawrence's art of portraiture.
./images/420.jpg	AMERLING, Friedrich von	Oil on panel	Amerling worked in a style that combined the elegance of British portraiture with the realism of the Viennese Biedermeier tradition. His sitters included not only members of the royal family but also the wealthy upper classes, prominent citizens and even fellow artists. He also produced a number of portrait studies such as this picture, which show just the sitter's head. These studies are notable for their spontaneity and immediacy.

./images/423.jpg	AMERLING, Friedrich von	Oil on canvas	The Countess Nákó, née Berta Gyertyánffy (1820-82), the wife of a Transylvanian aristocrat who lived in Vienna and Pest alternatively, was an exceptional personality. While her contemporaries appeared timid and docile, she was a self-assured woman. She is seated at her desk in a dignified pose; the writing utensils indicate that her interest went beyond the narrow limits of family life. She learnt to paint from Amerling; she was an excellent pianist, as well as a composer of music. Her salon was frequented by musicians and painters, including Richard Wagner and Franz Liszt. Amerling did not disguise the countess's magnetic, matured womanliness. By including personal objects and the dog nuzzling to its mistress, in the grandiose composition, Amerling created a portrait which is near to genre painting.

./images/425.jpg	AMERLING, Friedrich von	Oil on canvas	In this unfinished self-portrait the artist depicted himself in profile from the left and with a serious and attentive look. He dispensed with any attributes of his art, such as brush or easel, and did not adopt an artificial pose, contenting himself with a clearly circumscribed partial view.

./images/427.jpg	AMICO FRIULANO DEL DOSSO	Oil on canvas	This painting depicts a gentleman with a sword, three-quarter length, a landscape with a walled city beyond. Strong contrasts between light and dark define the painting: the beams of light from the leaden sky pick out certain parts of the landscape while other passages remain in penumbra. Nothing is known about the identity of the sitter; on the basis of the style of the costume, the portrait can be dated to 1515-20. The town in the background could possibly be Cividale, in Friuli.The portrait has borne many different attributions over the years, from Titian to Dosso to Lorenzo Lotto, while Federico Zeri classified it as a work by Girolamo Marchesi da Cotignola. The attribution to the Amico Friulano del Dosso is, however, by far the most convincing.

./images/430.jpg	AMIGONI, Jacopo	Oil on canvas	Juno (Greek Hera) was the chief goddess of Olympus, both the sister and wife of Jupiter (Zeus). Her role in myth and are is principally that of the wife of a faithless husband, always plotting revenge on his many lovers. Her usual attribute is the peacock which was sacred to her in antiquity. In one of the affairs of Jupiter, the giant Argus of hundred eyes was set by Juno to watch over Io, the lover of Jupiter. When Argus was murdered by Mercury, in memory of Argus Juno took his eyes and set them in the tail of her peacock (Met. 1:721-4).Juno and Mercury, one of four mythologies painted by Amigoni for Moor Park, remains too little idealized, and faintly ludicrous. Imagination has been less exercised than industry; Amigoni's people are real enough to be commonplace - and to feel somewhat at ease when shown sitting on clouds. with Amigoni the rococo remains solid and earthbound.
./images/431.jpg	AMIGONI, Jacopo	Oil on canvas	The painting represents a lady, three-quarter length, wearing a blue and white velvet dress and seated in a sumptuous interior.
./images/432.jpg	AMIGONI, Jacopo	Oil on canvas	This painting relates the story of Jael and Sisera in tones of delicate colours that contrast emphatically with the drama of the biblical event recounted. It was painted after the artist's return too Venice from travels that took him to most of Europe, when his palette became brighter and more refined.Sisera was a cruel Canaanite leader who ruled the Israelites for twenty years. Barak defeated his nine hundred charioteers by a surprise Israelite attack. Sisera escaped and sought refuge in the tent of Jael, wife of Heber the Kenite. She gave the terrified Canaanite sanctuary. When he fell asleep, she drove a tent peg into his brain. The act fulfilled the prediction of Debora, prophetess and Israelite leader, who foresaw that a woman would slay Sisera.
./images/433.jpg	AMIGONI, Jacopo	Oil on canvas	Born in Naples but trained as an artist in Venice, Jacopo Amigoni soon began working in the Rococo style. Like Sebastiano Ricci and Pellegrino he often left Venice to work as one of Europe's foremost cosmopolitan artists, fixing the evanescent rather fragile delicacy of his style in great frescoes and paintings of historical subjects both profane and sacred. Charmingly Rococo in taste are the small canvases too, usually with some mythological or courtly subject. A typical example of this type is the painting of 'Venus and Adonis', executed with arcadian grace in the sharpness of the composition and the clarity and softness of the colours soaked in a jewelled and diaphanous luminosity.The story of Venus and Adonis, which has attracted not only artists but poets, including Shakespeare, tells that Adonis was the offspring of the incestuous union of King Cinyras of Paphos, in Cyprus, with his daughter Myrrha. His beauty was a byword. Venus conceived a helpless passion for him as a result of a chance graze she received from Cupid's arrow (Met. 10:524-559). One day while out hunting Adonis was slain by a wild boar, an accident Venus had always dreaded (Met. 10:708-739). Hearing his dying groans as she flew overhead in her chariot, she came down to aid him but was too late. In the place where the earth was stained with Adonis' blood, anemones sprouted. Artists usually depict two scenes, Amigoni painted both.The first scene is shown on this picture. Adonis, arrow (spear in other versions) in hand and hunting dog (or dogs) straining at the leash, is impatient to be off, while Venus imploringly tries to hold him back.

./images/436.jpg	AMIGONI, Jacopo	Oil on canvas	Amigoni moved to London in 1729, where he remained for a decade, enjoying much success and significant patronage among the English aristocracy. During his stay in England, the artist provided large-scale mythological and historical scenes and decorative schemes for the country's many stately homes.

./images/438.jpg	AMIGONI, Jacopo	Oil on canvas	Amigoni had spent his early career in Venice, but he left the city to make a name for himself as an international artist, quickly finding an avid audience in the various courts of Europe which had developed a taste for the charm of the Venetian Rococo. In 1730, Amigoni arrived in London fresh from a series of pictorial triumphs in Venice, Rome and at the court of the Elector of Bavaria, and soon had eager patrons amongst the English nobility and even royalty.The pair of canvases of mythological subjects, Venus and Adonis, and Bacchus and Ariadne, represent one of the most important works by Amigoni from his seminal English sojourn. These subjects represent two of the most recognizable and classic of all mythological stories, both with a rich history of pictorial representation in Venetian art. They are taken from Ovid's Metamorphoses, and in the case of Venus and Adonis, Amigoni returned to the subject throughout his career.

This posthumous portrait of Rossini, who spent several decades in the French capital where he was known for his sharp wit, appears to have been executed from a photograph, as its oval format may indicate. In the wave of renewed Italian nationalism, the painting may have been intended as a symbolic gesture to bring the Italian composer back to his native country.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 8 minutes):Gioacchino Rossini: L'Italiana in Algeri, overture

./images/480.jpg	ANDERSON, William	Oil on canvas	"The painting depicts an English 3rd-rate ship of the line (74 guns) in three positions off Table Mountain, Cape Town, South Africa, flying the Royal Nay ensign.The popularity and prestige of the large two-decker 74-gun Ships of the line (""74"") reached its peak during the French Revolutionary War when the British found that not only did they sail better than the stately three-decker but that by superior gunnery and training their two-deckers could be a match for any enemy warship, even three-deckers of over one hundred guns. Napoleon Bonaparte was sent to St Helena in the Northumberland 74 after he had surrendered to the captain of Bellerophon 74. For years the very words seventy-four were synonymous to the British public with an invincible naval supremacy."

./images/484.jpg	ANDREA DA FIRENZE	Fresco	The end wall (the north wall) of the chancel chapel is devoted entirely to three scenes from the Passion of Christ: the Bearing of the Cross at bottom left, the Crucifixion in the middle, and the Descent into Hell at bottom right. The Crucifixion extends over the entire width of the upper wall segment as a multifigure image of Golgotha. In this scene the crosses of the two thieves create recessional axes into space, although the actual space depicted is relatively shallow. The thieves twist convulsively on their crosses while a group of figures runs from an attacking soldier at the right.The Crucifixion image derives from Sienese examples such as Simone Martini's fresco in the lower church  of San Francesco, Assisi, and Lippo Memmi's fresco in the Collegiata, San Gimignano.The thematic continuation of the Passion scenes is found on the vault frescoes in the Resurrection, the Miracle of Pentecost, and the Ascension of Christ.

In the middle of the upper section, St Thomas Aquinas, seated on a throne and surrounded by an aureole, presents an open book to the viewer. Floating above the saint's throne are the four cardinal virtues and the three theological virtues, the topmost being Caritas. Seated to the left of Thomas, from the viewer's standpoint, are Job, David, Paul, Mark, and John the Evangelist; to the right, Solomon, Isaiah, Moses, Luke, and Matthew. Crouching at the feet of the saint, their bearing and gestures expressing resignation, are the heretics, Sabellius, Averroës, and Arius.In the lower register a uniform row of fourteen thrones extends like a line of choir stalls across the wall. Seated on the thrones on the right side are female personifications of the liberal arts, their antique and biblical representatives at their feet.

The antique and biblical representatives of the liberal arts (Priscian, Cicero, Aristotle, Tubalcain, Ptolemy, Euclid, and Pythagoras) are at their feet. Priscian was a Latin grammarian who lived in the 6th century AD. Cicero was a Roman lawyer, orator and statesman, 1st century BC. Aristotle was a Greek philosopher, 4th century BC, who invented formal logic. Tubalcain was a metalworker, mentioned in Genesis, identified with music possibly through a misunderstanding by Isidore of Seville. Ptolemy was a Greek astronomer, 2nd century AD, whose system prevailed until Copernicus. Euclid was a Greek mathematician, 3rd century BC; his textbook was used for 2000 years. Pythagoras was a Greek philosopher and mathematician, 6th century BC.In addition, the personifications of the seven planets are found in the tympana of the thrones.
./images/514.jpg	ANDREA DA FIRENZE	Fresco	On the entrance wall (south wall) seven scenes from the life of St Peter Martyr, another saint of the Dominican order, are located. The central section of the wall has largely been destroyed by the addition of a gallery installed during a subsequent period. The thematic accent of the scenes has primarily placed on the saint's posthumous miracles. For example, the fresco to the left of the entrance (shown here) depicts pilgrims pressing toward the tomb of the saint, seeking to be healed of their afflictions through prayer and touching his shrine.

His head hangs onto his right shoulder and shows the marks from the crown of thorns, with blood oozing from his wounds. The figure of Christ on the cross is very similar to that in the fresco of theCrucifixion in the Spanish Chapelin S. Maria Novella in Florence, dated 1566—68 and also executed by Andrea da Firenze.Mary stands to the left of the cross, her hands joined in a mournful gesture, gazing at her son. The figure of Saint John the Evangelist at the right is depicted in a slightly more active posture of mourning than the motionless Virgin. He has his hands joined in front of his chest, and his look toward Christ expresses sorrow and disbelief. A Dominican friar kneels at the foot of the cross, embracing it, while his lips appear to be kissing the feet of Christ.Two angels are at either side of the cross; they also mourn. The left angel has covered his face with part of his garment, and the right angel is supporting his head with his hand. Angels that are able toexpress emotionsfirst appear in works by Giotto. Their depiction soon became very popular in trecento painting."

./images/534.jpg	ANDREA DEL CASTAGNO	Fresco	In 1442 Andrea went to Venice where he frescoed the ceiling of the chapel of St Tarasius in the church of San Zaccaria together with an artist known as Francesco da Faenza (probably Francesco Torelli). This is the painter's first signed and dated work, although earlier, presumably in 1440-41, he had already painted a Crucifixion with Saints for the monastery of Santa Maria degli Angeli, today in the hospital of Santa Maria Nuova. Both this painting and the San Zaccaria frescoes depicting God the Father, Saints and Evangelists, show what a strong influence the work of Masaccio and Donatello had on the young Andrea. And in particular, Andrea's interest in Donatello's sculptural and linear dynamic power already evident in the Santa Maria degli Angeli Crucifixion, becomes much more obvious in the ceiling frescoes in San Zaccaria. Clear-cut outlines define the Masaccesque sculptural figures, so that their forms are strengthened and hardened.
./images/535.jpg	ANDREA DEL CASTAGNO	Fresco	During the first half of the fifteenth century, Florentine artists including Donatello, Paolo Uccello, and Andrea del Castagno traveled to other cities, bringing with them the new style that had been developed. In fact, Andrea del Castagno's earliest known work is represented by frescoes in Venice. They are rather harsh, direct, and uncompromising images that emphasize the more realistic current that is sometimes found in Donatello's sculpture. The picture shown is the seated God the Father holding a globe.
./images/536.jpg	ANDREA DEL CASTAGNO	Fresco	The vault of the original choir (now transformed into the chapel named Capella di San Tarasio) of San Zaccaria, Venice, was painted when Castagno was about twenty-one, in 1442. The frescoes depicting God the Father, Saints and Evangelists are painted on narrow, sharply curved compartments between the ribs and consequently are particularly hard to photograph effectively. The style reflects a careful study by the young painter of Donatello's sculpture - especially the Zuccone and Jeremiah — with its broad treatment of sturdy figures with puffy draperies, its intensity of expression, and even such secondary details as putti. Features from Uccello may also be detected, but the most important pictorial force acting upon Castagno seems to have been the example of Domenico Veneziano, whose participation in the same fresco program has been suggested.

./images/538.jpg	ANDREA DEL CASTAGNO	Mosaic	The drawing for the mosaic of the Death of the Virgin in the Mascoli Chapel in St Mark's also dates from Castagno's Venetian period. The attribution to Andrea of this work has long been a matter of controversy, but recently critics have argued convincingly that Andrea's style is clearly recognizable in the architectural construction in the background and in the peaceful, contemplative mood in which the figures are portrayed, with a total absence of drama.
./images/539.jpg	ANDREA DEL CASTAGNO	Mosaic	The picture shows the mosaic on the right side of the barrel vault of the Mascoli Chapel in St Mark's. It represents the Visitation and the Dormition of the Virgin. Although Jacopo Bellini and Michele Giambono also worked on the cartoon of the mosaic, the composition of the mosaic is by Andrea, who probably produced the cartoon for the mosaic before leaving Venice in 1442. The project was left to languish until the late 1440s, when Venice was more receptive to Florentine style. Then Bellini and Giambono added their own figures, suggesting either that Andrea  left the work unfinished or that it was damaged in the intervening years.

./images/541.jpg	ANDREA DEL CASTAGNO	Stained glass	In the cartoon for the Deposition on one of the stained-glass windows in the dome of Florence Cathedral, Andrea appears to be expressing an emotional intimacy and a formal harmony that are the result of the changing cultural reality: for the Florentine art scene in those years was dominated not only by painters such as Paolo Uccello, Filippo Lippi and Angelico, but also by Domenico Veneziano. The influence of Domenico Veneziano's painting becomes even stronger in the decoration of the refectory of Sant'Apollonia which Andrea painted between June and October 1447.
./images/542.jpg	ANDREA DEL CASTAGNO	Fresco	The painting depicts Madonna and Child enthroned with Sts Jerome and John the Baptist, two angels, and two children from the Pazzi family.The painting that Andrea frescoed in the chapel in the Castle of Trebbio (Pontassieve), belonging to the Pazzi family, is influenced by Domenico Veneziano's peaceful and luminous painting. Despite the strong naturalism of the two saints on either side of the Madonna, the scene is characterized by a gentleness of forms, a delicacy of colour harmonies, and a majestic composition that Andrea had most probably borrowed from Veneziano's Carnesecchi Tabernacle and his frescoes in Sant'Egidio.The polychrome marble tiles on the floor, the carpet covering the steps, and the glimpse of the two angels in flight show the expertise achieved by Andrea del Castagno in terms of perspective, while the statuary quality of the figures reflects the artist's attention to the sculptural work of Donatello. The ornamental motifs on the fabrics and floors almost dominate the figures and add a sumptuous richness to the composition, in line with its private destination.
./images/543.jpg	ANDREA DEL CASTAGNO	Fresco	"The influence of Domenico Veneziano's painting is strong in the decoration of the refectory of Sant'Apollonia which Andrea painted between June and October 1447. He solved the problem posed by the height of the refectory walls in Sant'Apollonia by using the old method of arranging the scenes in two rows, one above the other, but he gave them a visual unity: the Stories of Christ's Passion frescoed on the upper level are in fact conceived as taking place in a space behind the room where the Last Supper on the lower level is happening. The three scenes from the Passion (the Resurrection, Crucifixion and Entombment) are connected to each other by a group of flying angels all converging towards the figure of Christ in the centre, and by a common landscape background, which has been correctly judged ""the most powerful interpretation, of the Tuscan landscape in the entire history of painting"" (Berti).The scene that has been most highly praised, and which is probably the best preserved, is the Resurrection, originally the first to the left."

./images/548.jpg	ANDREA DEL CASTAGNO	Fresco	The scene that has been most highly praised, and which is probably the best preserved, is the Resurrection, originally the first to the left. Here, Christ rises up with the monumentality and the solidity of a statue, only slightly mellowed by his melancholy expression and the pale, soft daylight surrounding him. Below him, a group of soldiers lie sound asleep; only one of them has just woken up and observes the incredible event with his mouth open. His features are almost deformed by a blackish shading which makes the modelling hard and sharpedged.The obvious analogies between this fresco and thesame subjectpainted several years later by Piero della Francesca in Borgo San Sepolcro has been the object of many critical studies. The simplicity and the perfect perspective composition of the fresco in Sant'Apollonia is considered by some scholars an anticipation of the art of Piero, whereas others think that it is rather a reflection of it.
./images/549.jpg	ANDREA DEL CASTAGNO	Fresco	One of Andrea del Castagno's most famous works is the Last Supper he painted below the stories from Christ's Passion. Until quite recently the Last Supper appeared to be painted in much darker colours than the scenes directly above it; the fact had given rise to many animated debates between scholars concerning the dating of the fresco. But after the latest cleaning (1977-79) the colour and tonal contrast between the two levels has disappeared, and the colours of the Last Supper have been restored to their original beauty.All scholars agree in praising the sobre architectural structure of the room where the scene of the Last Supper is taking place: a room in the austere style of Alberti, with the lavish coloured marble panels functioning as a backdrop to the heavy and solemn scene of the banquet. Notice also the beauty of some of the minor details, such as the gold highlights in some of the characters' hair or the haloes depicted in perfect perspective. The other extraordinary element of this fresco is the remarkable balance of gestures and expressions, particularly in the group of figures in the centre of the composition, where the innocent sleep of St John to the left of Jesus is contrasted to the tense, rigid figure of Judas sitting opposite.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 8 minutes):Johann Sebastian Bach: St. Matthew Passion BWV 244 (excerpts)

For this scene, Castagno created an engaging space with imitation marble wall plaques and the sharply foreshortened floor and ceiling. The figures are arranged behind a long narrow table, with the exception of the Apostle at each end and Judas Iscariot isolated on the front side. The central group, composed of four figures, Judas, Christ, Peter, and John, is visually emphasized by a dramatically coloured red marble slab.

./images/560.jpg	ANDREA DEL CASTAGNO	Fresco	Andrea was commissioned the Legnaia Famous Persons cycle no later than June 1449, when Filippo Carducci, the owner of the villa and most probably the one who commissioned the frescoes, died. The frescoes were finished before the house was sold in October 1451.The Legnaia cycle consists of nine portrayals (three Florentine military commanders, three famous women and three Tuscan poets), placed inside painted niches made to look like monumental marble recesses, separated by pilasters. On one of the room's short walls, the figures of Adam and Eve were painted.The picture shows a digital reconstruction by Lew Minter of the Famous Men and Women fresco cycle originally in the loggia of the Villa Carducci, Legnaia. The width of the loggia is approximately 15,5 m. The figures from he left are: Eve, Madonna and Child (over the door, largely lost), Adam (largely lost), Pippo Spano, Farinata degli Uberti, Niccolò Acciaioli, Cumaean Sibyl, Queen Esther, Queen Tomyris, Dante, Petrarch. The third Florentine literary figure in the cycle, Boccaccio, next to Petrarch, is not shown in this reconstruction. The nine figures from the long wall have been detached and exhibited in the Uffizi, while the frescoes representing Adam and Eve and the Virgin and Child on one end wall of the loggia remain in poor condition in the villa.

The masterful draughtsmanship and the perceptive description of the character, shown in a natural pose, confirm the opinion Vasari expressed of Andrea's work: ""He was extremely talented at portraying figures in solemn poses and in making them awesome, both men and women, with fierce expressions created thanks to his excellent draughtsmanship."""

The severity of her face, which is both beautiful and dignified, together with her raised right hand, is the sign of the gravity of her prophecies.A famous collection of sibylline prophecies, the Sibylline Books, was traditionally offered for sale to Tarquinius Superbus, the last of the seven kings of Rome, by the Cumaean sibyl. He refused to pay her price, so the sibyl burned six of the books before finally selling him the remaining three at the price she had originally asked for all nine. The books were thereafter kept in the temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill, to be consulted only in emergencies.

Petrarch's inquiring mind and love of classical authors led him to travel, visiting men of learning and searching monastic libraries for classical manuscripts. He was regarded as the greatest scholar of his age.
./images/573.jpg	ANDREA DEL CASTAGNO	Panel	"On 20 November 1449 the Rector of the church of San Miniato alle Torri asked Andrea to paint an altarpiece depicting Our Lady of the Assumption with Saints Miniato and Julian, today in Berlin. By April 1450 the altarpiece was finished and the artist began to receive his first payments.The Virgin is portrayed wrapped in a wide dark cloak, with hard-edged. lines, as she is carried up to heaven on a throne of reddish clouds supported by four flying angels whose carefully calculated poses and gestures offer us a further example of Andrea's ability at depicting angels ""in the air,"" a talent that Vasari praised at great length. The two monumental saints on either side of the Madonna also appear to be floating in a conventional and abstract space. The scene is dominated by the harmonies and contrast of the bright colours."
./images/574.jpg	ANDREA DEL CASTAGNO	Panel	It is assumed that this small panel was a predella painting. In this painting, as in the Berlin Madonna, Andrea's attention appears to be concentrated on the monumentality of the figures, the brightness of the colours, whose brilliance replaces natural light.The painting is not accepted as autograph works by all scholars.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 22 minutes):Guillaume Dufay: Hymns
./images/575.jpg	ANDREA DEL CASTAGNO	Tempera on leather on wood	"The unusual shape of this work is explained by its original use as a parade shield. Its painted scene is exceedingly rare -- most parade shields were decorated with simple coats of arms. This is, in fact, the only shield painted by a recognized master that has survived to the present day. It may have been carried in civic or religious processions or have been made as a sign of  authority for a citizen-governor.Images of young David, who overcame seemingly insurmountable odds to kill the giant, were popular in fifteenth-century Florence, the smallest major power in Italy. The city saw itself threatened by such Goliaths as the pope, the duke of Milan, the king of Naples, and the doge of Venice. David's image is especially appropriate decoration for a shield since, throughout the Psalms, David's poetry echoes the notion of God as his shield: ""His truth shall be thy shield and buckler"" (Ps. 91.4).Like many early Renaissance artists, Castagno has presented the action and its outcome simultaneously: David holds the loaded sling, but already the head of the slain Goliath lies at his feet. David's energetic pose, based perhaps on an ancient statue, creates a strong contour that would have been clear and ""legible"" as the shield was carried. Nevertheless, the youth's body is  well modeled, rounded with light and shadow to give a convincing likeness of a body in action.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 11 minutes):Johann Kuhnau: The Fight between David and Goliath (No. 1 of the 6 Stories from the Bible illustrated in music)"
./images/576.jpg	ANDREA DEL CASTAGNO	Fresco	"Probably in 1453, Andrea moved to the church of Santissima Annunziata, where he painted two frescoes (St Julian and the Redeemer; The Holy Trinity, St Jerome and Two Saints) that are typical of his late style. No longer interested in the heroic and monumental characteristics illustrated in the Legnaia cycle, Andrea here imbues his figures with the crude truth that he had gradually mastered over a lifetime of hard work.A deeply realistic mood dominates the figure of St Jerome in the fresco in the Corboli Chapel in the Santissima Annunziata. The saint is portrayed as a fully convinced Renaissance ascetic, possessing both humanity and mysticism. In this painting we are immediately struck by a few details that are so realistic they are almost too crude, like the old saint's body with blood gushing out of the many wounds. Above, the Holy Trinity ""with a Crucifix in foreshortening; it is so well executed that Andrea deserves great praise for it, for he painted foreshortenings in a much better and more modern manner than any artist had done before him"" (Vasari)."

The figure of the saint is no longer the sophisticated gentleman we saw in the Berlin Madonna: he is simply a young man who is sincerely contrite for the harm he has caused. Above his hair, rendered with golden highlights, the metallic halo realistically reflects the saint's head. Above Julian, partly concealed by pinkish clouds, Christ imparts his blessing. On either side of the saint, in the midst of a lovely Tuscan landscape, Andrea has illustrated some episodes from his life.
./images/578.jpg	ANDREA DEL CASTAGNO	Fresco	In the Greek Library in the Vatican, Andrea del Castagno was intent on painting illusionist architecture that would transform the room into a columned hall open on all sides.
./images/579.jpg	ANDREA DEL CASTAGNO	Fresco	In the summer of 1455, the painter is back in Florence, where he executed another fresco in the church of Santissima Annunziata: a depiction of Lazarus together with Martha and Mary Magdalene, unfortunately destroyed. This fresco must also have been characterized by the same heightened realism visible in the other paintings in the church, and which we come across also in another work dating from this same period, the Crucifixion Andrea painted for the convent of Santa Maria degli Angeli, today in Sant'Apollonia.The composition is basically identical to the first Crucifixion that Andrea had painted several years earlier for this same convent, but the later work lays greater stress on realistic details. The Christ figure, for instance, is no longer the same dignified Masaccesque man he was in the first fresco: here he is shown with harsh features, almost more like a suffering peasant.
./images/580.jpg	ANDREA DEL CASTAGNO	Fresco	
./images/581.jpg	ANDREA DEL CASTAGNO	Tempera on panel	Castagno showed an almost obsessive interest in naturalism in his portraits; the Portrait of a Gentleman in the National Gallery, Washington can today be safely attributed to him. The young man, portrayed in three-quarter profile and not in full profile as was the custom, is a typical Castagno figure, with his unmistakable strong sculpturalism.This picture is one of the landmarks of Italian portraiture: the earliest surviving painted portrait in three-quarter view, with the figure, splendidly dressed in the most costly red, seen against the sky, shown to the waist, with his right hand clutching the long end of a hood worn over the shoulder.
./images/582.jpg	ANDREA DEL CASTAGNO	Fresco	Not long after the SS. Annunziata comission, the Opera del Duomo commissioned the monument to the commander Niccolò da Tolentino, which Andrea completed in March 1456. For this painting Castagno had to revert to the monumental and heroic model he had used in the Legnaia cycle. His description of the tense muscles of the horse and the general's furrowed face are very acute naturalistic observations that break the rigidity of that model.A comparison of Andrea's Tolentino with Paolo Uccello'sSir John Hawkwood,painted in the same cathedral several years earlier (1436), is inevitable. While Uccello froze the horse and its rider into a static composition of rigid geometric precision, Andrea expressed through the tension and movement of this fresco all the restlessness and vitality of his spirit.The Monument to Niccolò da Tolentino in Florence Cathedral is the last work by Castagno that still survives; in 1457 he frescoed a Last Supper for the convent of Santa Maria degli Angeli, but it has not come down to us.

./images/584.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Oil on wood	Andrea painted this work for the convent of San Gallo which was subsequently destroyed in the siege of Florence (1529). The panel was then transported by the Augustinian Brothers to their new seat, San Jacopo tra i Fossi, whence in 1626 it passed into the possession of the Grand Duchess Maria Maddalena who transferred  it to the chapel then being built in Palazzo Pitti. It is an early work of Andrea done when Pontormo was in his workshop.The atmosphere is charged with ancient references quoted blithely in the theatrical background which forms a setting for the almost unrecognizable biblical story. It is usually interpreted as Susanna and the Elders - a Susanna who resembles a male nude; the Elders, three of them, lightly touched in with a few brushstrokes, are pointing to her up in an airy loggia worthy of Pontormo or Rosso. The two figures of the Madonna and the Angel in the foreground, accompanied by two angels, full of gentle human beauty, are vibrant with poetic intensity.
./images/585.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Fresco	"Andrea del Sarto's early work echoes of Leonardo, Raphael, and Fra Bartolomeo can be observed, but it is the naturalism of Andrea""'s teacher Piero di Cosimo - in whose shop he remained from about 1498 to 1508 - that is most evident in his frescoes of the life of St Philip Benizzi. There are located in the atrium of the Santissima Annunziata, near Baldovinetti's light-filled Nativity. Throughout the series, Andrea retained the sense of outdoor light and atmosphere seen in Baldovinetti's fresco; this was suggested by the site itself, which was filled with sunlight. The fantastic landscape masses, jutting rocks, and trees in the scene in which the saint punishes gamblers derive from Piero di Cosimo."
./images/586.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Fresco	Andrea del Sarto's impressively fluent and richly lyrical style is manifested first in his series of five mural paintings depicting scenes from the story of the spiritual founder of the Servite Order, Filippo Benizzi. They were created for the atrium of the important pilgrimage church of Santissima Annunziata in Florence from 1509 onwards. They were followed by two more frescoes with biblical subjects on the opposite side of the space, the last of which, the Birth of the Virgin is dated 1514.The Journey of the Magi represents an almost unprecedented subject showing the three Magi arriving in train at Herod's palace displaying portraits of contemporaries.
./images/587.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Fresco	In the atrium of Santissima Annunziata, the Servite church in Florence, lunette frescoes on the left side of the courtyard portray the life of the patron saint of the order, Filippo Benizzi. One episode from his life had already been frescoed by Cosimo Rosselli in the fifteenth century. Andrea del Sarto turned it into a series with five more scenes in 1509-10. The last painting on the entrance side shows a miraculous cure by Filippo Benizzi's relics. A priest in an apse is showing the holy objects, and the people are approaching from the front and sides. The motifs of an arch and columns harmonize with the real architecture of the atrium.
./images/588.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Frescoes	This view of the atrium in Santissima Annunziata in Florence shows the frescoes from left to right, St Philip Benizzi Curing the Leper by Andreas del Sarto (1509-10), The Vocation of St Philip Benizzi by Cosimo Rosselli (c. 1475), and the Nativity by Baldovinetti (1460-62).
./images/589.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Fresco	The interior is vast and elaborate, dominated by the huge canopy of the bed of the woman in labour, and defined in all its vastness by elegant architectural features and furnishings. In this grandiose framework, which presupposes Andrea's clear knowledge of what Raphael and Michelangelo had been working in Rome, the women are moving slowly attending with serene solicitude to the tasks as laid down by the account  in the apocryphal Gospels, leading the scene an absolutely original kind of animation.
./images/590.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Fresco	In Andrea's hands, the use of monochromatic pigments in this fresco creates an almost silvery aura. The subject of the Baptism of the People offered a challenge appropriate to a painter of his generation and of his innate skills. The emphasis is upon the rendering of the figure and in particular the nude in a variety of poses and states of undress, consistent with the subject matter.
./images/591.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Red chalk	This remarkable drawing, executed in preparation for the mural of the Baptism of the People in the Chiostro dello Scalzo in Florence, is a figure study for the St John the Baptist. In the drawing, presumably made directly from a model, the Baptist is nude, while in the painting he is partially covered with heavy drapery.
./images/592.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Fresco	For the Florentine Compagnia dello Scalzo, Andrea del Sarto frescoed the atrium of the brotherhood's chapel. The artist worked on it from 1509 to 1526, with interruptions. A frieze depicts the life of John the Baptist, the patron saint of the brotherhood. Sarto executed the entire decoration in grisaille. This did not just save the brotherhood money, the renunciation of colour also express the rigor and humility of its communal ideal.
./images/593.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Oil on canvas (transferred)	Like Leonardo, Andrea del Sarto was called to France, where he produced a painting in harmony with his compatriot's pictorial ideals. The personification of Charity holds two children while another, slightly older, is asleep at her feet. In the lower left corner is a trompe l'oeil scrap of paper bearing the date and the artist's name. The entire scene is located in an idealized landscape.
./images/594.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Oil on wood	"Giorgio Vasari, who frequented Andrea del Sarto's studio as a young man, defined him as ""the flawless painter"". His style, shaped by his studies of the works of Michelangelo and Raphael, and characterised by an exquisitely balanced composition and high level of formal control, strongly influenced 16th Florentine painting, to such an extent that it was considered a precursor of Mannerism.Andrea del Sarto was commissioned to execute the Virgin and Child between Sts Francis of Assisi and John the Evangelist (called the Madonna of the Harpies) for the nuns of the convent of St Francis de'Macci. Within its solid and meticulous compositional structure, the artist almost seamlessly combines the typical pyramidal shape of the Virgins painted by Raphael with the statuesque feel of the figures created by Michelangelo, mellowing them with the delicate, shaded colours of Leonardo da Vinci.The traditional title of the painting was coined based on Vasari's identification of the monsters depicted on the Virgin's pedestal as harpies. However, based on an iconographic interpretation of the work, which assigns an eschatological symbolism to the subject, today critics mostly agree that they depict the locusts described in St John the Evangelist's Apocalypse."
./images/595.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Oil on wood	"Perhaps the most famous work of Andrea del Sarto is the altarpiece painted for the nuns of San Francesco dei Macci, known as the Madonna of the Harpies.According to the contract signed on May 14, 1515 the picture was to depict the Madonna and Child crowned by two angels and flanked by St John the Evangelist and St Bonaventure, and to be delivered within a year. But in fact the work is dated 1517, and shows St John the Evangelist and St Francis on either side of the Madonna and Child on a high polygonal pedestal. The latter is decorated at the corners with monster-like figures (the so-called Harpies), while in the centre, beneath the artist's signature, are the opening words of a hymn to Our Lady of the Assumption. We therefore have not the Coronation of the Virgin but the Virgin of the Assumption.These variations on the original commission, and the subject itself, which is not a traditional Madonna and Child Enthroned between Two Saints, but a highly unusual presentation of the Virgin, full-figure on that enigmatic pedestal with the images of the ""harpies,"" have led to a lot of thought and attempted explanations on the part of all critics. The most recent interpretation is that it is a depiction, based on the text of the Book of Revelations, of the Virgin triumphant over evil, symbolized by the monstrous figures, the ""harpies,"" which are in fact the ""locusts"" mentioned in Revelations; and besides that, bears witness to the cult of the Virgin by the clients, the conventual Franciscans.Having removed the layers of dirt and overpainting, the 1984 restoration has re-established the exceptionally rich colouring of the work, praised by Vasari as being ""of singular and truly rare beauty."" The figure of the Madonna, wrought into a composed chiasmus in order to balance the weight of the Child (who on the other hand is lively, smiling, and as ambiguous as Rosso's putti), lights up the centre of the picture with the intense rose-colour of her robe tempered by harmony with the pale blue of her mantle, and with the brilliant yellow of the light fabric draped over her shoulders beneath the beautiful drapery of the white veil covering her head. On her left is the sculptural St John (painted from a terracotta model by Sansovino) swathed in a cinnabar red mantle linked to the lilac of his robe by means of a highly refined drapery, while on the other side the figure of St Francis strikes a clear note that emerges by subtle varieties of tone from the architectural motif of the background; while in the background one can once more see ""the smoke of transparent clouds veiling the architecture and the figures, that appear to move"" (Vasari): a warm, mysterious halo, made of colours and of shadows, that behind and around the figures impels an atmosphere that implies the rich spiritual message brought to us by this painting.The Madonna of the Harpies is truly a milestone in the career of Andrea del Sarto, and bears witness to the level of maturity of the most significant artistic experiences of the early 16th century: the ""atmospheric"" painting of Leonardo, the meditation recently infused with a new freshness in the ""grandiose"" manner of Michelangelo, the elegant and solemn classicism of Fra Bartolomeo endowed with a new intensity of colour after his stay in Venice, the experience of Raphael's work in Rome (and in this case the Sistine Madonna is usually mentioned); these are all motifs that come together in a single stylistic solution, the greatness of which was immediately recognized in Florence and elsewhere. This general admiration was shared almost two centuries later by Prince Ferdinando de' Medici, who acquired the picture for his collection in Palazzo Pitti, offering the nuns in exchange for it not only a copy of the picture done by Francesco Petrucci, but also the embellishment, and practically the remodeling and restoration of all the decoration of their church by Foggini."
./images/596.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Oil on wood	"The figure of the Madonna, wrought into a composed chiasmus in order to balance the weight of the Child, lights up the centre of the picture with the intense rose-colour of her robe tempered by harmony with the pale blue of her mantle, and with the brilliant yellow of the light fabric draped over her shoulders beneath the beautiful drapery of the white veil covering her head.For centuries - ever since a jjudgment by Vasari - the work was considered to be the prototype of classicism instilled into religious subjects, a refined synthesis of Leonardesque `sfumato', Raphaelesque balance, and plastic monumentality in the style of Michelangelo. Andrea del Sarto, who Vasari dubbed the ""painter without errors"", gives here a typical example of intellectual religiousness of clear neo-Platonic derivation."
./images/597.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Oil on panel	The sitter of this portrait is Lucrezia di Baccio del Fede, the artist's wife.
./images/598.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Oil on wood	According to Vasari, this painting is one of the two Madonnas painted by Andrea del Sarto for François I around 1516. The subject is the visit of St Elisabeth and the Infant St John at the Virgin and her Child.
./images/599.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Oil on wood	One is struck by the extraordinary originality of this composition, constructed on an X-shaped scheme which may be discerned beneath the violent emotional expressiveness of the three protagonists. The Madonna's sweet face is shadowed by the soft chiaroscuro that also gives depth and body to the colours. She is seated on the ground, like the traditional madonna of Humility, filling the space diagonally. In a dramatically unstable pose between her knees, a Child Jesus with an elongated body transforms the jocular movements of a putto into a tragic contortion of the limbs and of the smile, in the awareness of his destiny which is matched by a range of colours unusually cold for Andrea, based on subtle relations between grey and violet.Andrea del Sarto painted this large Madonna for the Florentine businessman Giovanni Gaddi.
./images/600.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Oil on canvas transferred from wood	One of the typical works of the artist's mature period, it was painted as an altarpiece. Saint Catherine is the portrait of Lucrezia, the wife of the artist.
./images/601.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Oil on wood	The young woman, shown in three-quarter view, is seated with her right arm on the back of the chair, while gazing out at the onlooker with a hint of an inviting smile. The dark background serves to highlight the wide-sleeved blue dress and white shirt, decorated with a floral pendant. She is holding a 'petrarchino', a printed copy of the Canzoniere by Francesco Petrarca, a very popular type of book in the 16th century, due to the small size that made it suitable for the private enjoyment of reading.We do not know the name of the woman. In this intense portrait, with its rich palette of blues, Andrea draws on the closest examples of portraiture, not only Florentine, from Raphael to the Venetians, such as Sebastiano del Piombo, or Lotto, from whom he takes the freer, more intimate style of interpretation.
./images/602.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Oil on wood	Great dignity and extreme tenderness can be seen in this superb portrait of Woman with a Basket of Spindles. For a long time it was thought to be by Pontormo and only recently attributed to Andrea del Sarto. This is possibly one of the paintings that Andrea del Sarto began and his assistant Jacopo Pontormo finished. Typical of Andrea, in fact, are the slightly rotating planes, aimed at defining a compact mass in movement, totally remote from the harsh, almost neo-Gothic line which distinguishes the portrait-painting of Pontormo. The heavy use of chiaroscuro takes nothing away from the chromatic richness of the clothes whose soft drapery confers to the woman a classic monumentality.
./images/603.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Oil on canvas	Laboratory examinations performed during the last restoration in 1986 have shown that this picture is a copy, albeit a very old and good one, of the portrait mentioned by Vasari in the first edition of his artists' biographies. It was executed in the late sixteenth-early seventeenth century, before 1635.

Tobias's little dog looks out at the viewer and wags his tail to add a sense of delightful immediacy to the work. St Leonard holds his attribute of prison fetters on top of a book rested on the arm of Tobias. The four youthful figures are set before an empty landscape and a uniform blue sky surmounted by a small, blessing Christ in Glory holding a Cross. Rather than the overall design, the innovative and vibrant aspects of the work are the treatment of colour and atmosphere.
./images/606.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Oil on canvas	The subject of this famous portrait - formerly thought to be a self-portrait - is an unknown young man looking up from his book.Daylight enters as if through a high and narrow window on our left. Brilliant on the gathered shirt, reflections from which define the curve of the jaw and the twist of the neck, it casts deep shadows on the eye sockets, smoulders in the dark eyes, shapes the skull under the triangular hat, lends mobility and colour to the distinctive features. The twisting pose is at once momentary and stable.
./images/607.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Fresco	"The twenty-five-year old Ottaviano de' Medici, on behalf of Cardinal Giulio de' Medici and his cousin Pope Leo X, commissioned Andrea del Sarto, Franciabigio and Pontormo for decorations celebrating the pope's father, Lorenzo the Magnificent, and other family members inside the family's villa at Poggio a Caiano. The iconographical programme, designed by the historian Paolo Giovio, aimed to evoke the celebrations of the Medici house through a series of episodes drawn from Roman history.Work in the Salone was halted with the death of Leo X in December 1521. Pontormo was the only one to have finished his lunette fresco, frescoes by Franciabigio and Andrea del Sarto on the long walls were partially incomplete.

The original edge of the frame ran immediately behind the figure of Caesar, and his elbow extended over the frame.

Several older men are standing or kneeling before him, pointing to the men bearing animals and vases at the left edge of the painting. Of all the animals that the Egyptian delegation brought to Florence, the giraffe was by far the most exciting for contemporaries.The fresco shows other animals as well: the dwarf sitting on the steps of Caesar's throne   is holding a chameleon on a tambourine; behind him sits a chimpanzee in a striped doublet, and an Oriental figure is carrying a long-tailed monkey. Another porter arrives with a cage full of blue and green parrots on his head. Finally, squatting at the foot of the steps  is an animal with a spotted coat, probably an African civet.

./images/615.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Oil on wood	"The painting was probably painted (along with a lost Nativity) for the Prior of the SS. Annunziata.The involvement of the onlooker is a pressing feature of this Lamentation, in which ""close-up"" is exploited to the full with great theatrical effect. The entire space (which has, however, been cut down along the sides from its original size) is filled by the compact group with the Madonna in the middle, upright in contrast to the lifeless body of Christ, and the two angels with their studied and opposed features. The emotion communicated is of an absolutely direct intensity."
./images/616.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Fresco	Leonardo's Last Supperwas copied and adapted in several refectories, particularly in Lombardy. Andrea del Sarto's fresco in the former refectory of the Vallombrosan monastery of San Salvi in Florence also testifies to knowledge of Leonardo's fresco. The impact and movement of Leonardo's figural composition have been moderated. Andrea's narrative is more human and touching; it reduces the heroic drama of gestures and figures. It shows a nearly enclosed hall, in whose articulations the row of apostles is embedded. The community at table with Christ is given a formal pendant in the form of a window loggia. A charming, anecdotal subsidiary motif results: two servants are conversing in the central opening. Above the entire scene is an arch with medallions displaying the Trinity and the saints of the order.
./images/617.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Fresco	The Cenacolo of San Salvi is possibly the one which most easily lends itself to the transformation into a museum, with its fairly large interiors on the ground and first floors. It was part of a Vallombrosan convent and it passed to the Ladies of Faenza. In 1511 a contract was drawn up with Andrea del Sarto for the decoration of the Refectory. Although commissioned at the beginning of his career, it was carried out slowly and was completed between 1520-25, a particularly fine period of the work of Andrea del Sarto.Miraculously spared during the Siege of Florence in 1529-30, the fresco is placed under a large arch containing painted medallions with the Trinity and four Saints, protectors of the Vallombrosan Order. Andrea's personality and background are evident in the fresco's innovations; he appears to be influenced by Leonardo and the Roman work of Michelangelo and Raphael, revealed in a work of magnificence and pre-baroque spontaneity.

./images/622.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Oil on wood	This painting shows Andrea del Sarto's general movement towards a more restrained, sculptural style. It was produced in the period after Sarto fled Florence during the plague of 1523, when he took refuge at the Camaldolese convent of Luco in the Mugello east of Florence. In the quiet of the country surrounded by the attentive sisters, he painted the Pietà for the altar of their church.The composition of the Pietà is predicated on the monumental figures set directly at the picture plane. The painter imposed his preferred x-shape on the design through the interlocking characters.
./images/623.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Oil on wood	This detail shows Mary Magdalene and a female saint. According to sources, the face of the Virgin is a portrait of Lucrezia del Fede and that of Mary Magdalene is the effigy of Maria del Berrettaio, respectively the wife and step-daughter of the artist.

./images/625.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Oil on wood	"In the same period as the Madonna of the Harpies, according to the evidence of Vasari confirmed by stylistic links, Andrea painted another great panel, for the altar of a chapel in the Augustinian church of San Gallo. At the time of the siege of Florence in 1529 it was taken to safety inside the walls, to San Jacopo tra' Fossi, as were the two earlier paintings (Noli me tangere and the Annunciation).The altarpiece features Sts Augustine, Sebastian, Lawrence, Peter Martyr, Francis and Mary Magdalen placed before an indistinct backdrop of sky and clouds resplendent with a compact image of the Trinity.The subject of the picture is not rare in central Italian painting during this period of spiritual and religious debate. We need only mention the emblematic solutions provided by Raphael for analogous themes with the Disputation on the Sacrament in the Stanza della Segnatura in the Vatican, or the Ecstasy of St Cecilia, painted in 1514 for the church of San Giovanni in Monte at Bologna. Moreover, it was particularly congenial to the Augustinian clients of the monastery of San Gallo, who wished to present a theme dear to St Augustine, who is in fact depicted while leading a lively debate among other saints, in the presence of a stupendous Magdalene with the features of Lucrezia kneeling beside St Sebastian.We get the best possible idea of the admiration aroused by the picture from the enthusiastic words of Bocchi: ""In this church there are three wonderful pictures by Andrea del Sarto: but the one on the right, with saints disputing about the Trinity, is of all pictures in all places the most wonderful. In this picture we see what a lively colouring, a drawing of rare quality, a unique mastery, can do. Who ever saw clothing so lifelike, or the reliefs of surfaces so marked, the features of persons so vivid, and liveliness so conforming with the truth?. . . It does not seem as if these figures were made of paint, but of flesh; not clothed by artifice, but by nature. But if for a moment we put aside the colours, and the artifice, we enter into the spirit of that which is true beyond any doubt; and it seems that the persons are thinking, and adopting bodily attitudes, and talking, and are anything other than painted.""The only additions one can make to this admiring judgment from the past arise from the recuperation of the exceptional colours of the Disputation, obtained by a restoration that has only just been completed. Apart from certain irreversible alterations, such as the oxidization of the verdigris spread by the painter on the mantle of St Sebastian in order to emphasize the effect of shadow in the folds, and apart from missing parts and abrasions caused by previous cleanings, the removal - or the careful and extremely prudent reduction - of the layers of dirt and coloured varnishes deposited over the surface in the course of centuries has enabled us to rediscover warm, intense and most refined harmonies of colour set against the deep blue-green space of a stormy sky. The ""palette"" now revealed to us appears very similar indeed to that of the Madonna of the Harpies, and confirms the theory that these two masterpieces date from the same time."
./images/626.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Charcoal on paper	This study from life is a preparatory drawing for the figure of St Peter Martyr in Andrea del Sarto's Disputation on the Trinity.
./images/627.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Oil on panel	The painting contains numerous exact quotations of Michelangelo and Raphael, though these are fused by Andrea in his own assured manner that gives form to a heroic and yet gentle humanity, and in an equilibrium that both enchants and involves the onlooker.The structure of the painting, representing the Holy Family and the Angel, is complex and based on a pyramid: at the apex is the Madonna, kneeling humbly and lovingly holding the tender boy of the Child reaching out towards the angel, who, together with St Joseph, composes the base of the composition. The links between the group and the landscape are supplied by the horizontal line of steps. On this plane he has placed the powerful figure of St Elizabeth, who, according to a story in the apocryphal Gospels, is leading the little Baptist off by the hand in order to escape the persecutions of Herod, going towards the vast blue spaces of the hills and mountains.
./images/628.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Oil on wood	This large altarpiece, called  Assunta Passerini, represents the miracle of the Assumption of the Virgin. The subject illustrates an ancient tradition, according to which Mary, being deprived of original sin, is the only one to be welcomed in heaven with the body and with the soul.Adapting the project he had previously developed for the Assunta Panciatichi, also at the Palatine Gallery, Andrea del Sarto proposes the typical iconographic scheme of the Renaissance, in which the scene of the assumption and that of the apostles are depicted together, on two levels. In the group of the apostles, we can identify St Nicholas and St Margaret, both kneeling, in the foreground. Looking towards the public, the first one wears a pink silk cope and is accompanied by the episcopal mitre, a book and the three golden spheres of the dowry which he gave to three poor young girls (his traditional attributes); St Margaret da Cortona is portrayed as a Franciscan tertiary, with a habit and a white veil. The presence of these two saints is explained by the commissioning of the painting: the altarpiece was in fact requested by Margherita Passerini between 1526 and 1528 for the high altar of Santa Maria dei Servi in Cortona. Both the father and the prematurely departed son of Margaret were called Nicholas, whose saint of reference is St Nicholas.The altarpiece combines clarity and dimness, substance and dissolution, reality and vision, in a manner that suggests some of the development of the Italian Baroque that would follow in the seventeenth century.
./images/629.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Oil on wood	The face of Mary in Andrea's huge Assumption bears the features of his wife. Seated on clouds, her hands folded in prayer, she is surrounded by sturdy putti.
./images/630.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Oil on wood	Vasari records this as being executed around 1529 for Bartolommeo Panciatichi the Elder. Andrea began it and carried it out almost to the end, but because the panel split several times as the work was begun and then suspended, the picture remained not entirely finished at his death.In this immense panel we have one of the most important work of Andrea (who is there represented in the person of the Apostle seen from the back, half-turned towards the spectator) on account of the fine composition divided between earth and sky, the figure of the standing Apostle serving as link between these parts.
./images/631.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Oil on wood	This is a celebrated picture. Although actually disfigured by bad restorations in old times which have changed the background and diminished the splendor and especially the interrelation of colors, there still remains the frank, original and lively conception of this youthful figure.The impressive image of the young Baptist, of an evocative power that in this case also one might call pre-Baroque, emerges from a dark grey background in which one glimpses the slightly pinkish rockface of a grotto. The athletic figure, the animal skin and the cloak are thrown into relief by a dramatic light that still illumines wonderful pictorial effects visible in the better preserved parts, such as the cross made of cane in the lower corner. These are the effects that will be taken up again by many of the Florentine painters of the 17th century.

./images/634.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Oil on wood	In his biography of Andrea del Sarto, Vasari mentions this painting right after a panel of the same subject painted for Zanobi Bracci. The latter picture survives: given to Cardinal Ferdinando de Medici it is now in the Galleria Palatina at the Palazzo Pitti in Florence. The picture now in Rome, painted for the same Zanobi, was originally installed in the chapel of the Villa di Rovezzano.Numerous copies of this celebrated work exist. Art historians set the date of the composition at 1528-29, comparing it to the Madonna, St Elizabeth and St John the Baptist that Andrea executed for Ottaviano de' Medici. The figure of St Joseph is clearly related to the Raphaelesque model of the Louvre Sacred Family, once owned by King François I.
./images/635.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Oil on wood	Vasari mentions this panel as having been painted for Becuccio, a glassmaker, from Gambassi, and adds that it had a predella with the lively portraits of Becuccio and his wife. (The two little tondi with the portraits are now in Chicago.) The represented saints are Lawrence, Onophrius, John the Baptist, Mary Magdalen, Sebastian and Roch. he panel was placed to an altar dedicated to the hermit saints Lawrence and Onophrius in the female monastery of the Eremite Benedictines, the Pieve di Sta Maria a Chianni a Gambassi.The design is symmetrical, forming a three-dimensional pyramid with the saints circled round the raised divine centre, with those in front kneeling down to admit the viewer's eye past them to the Virgin located further back in the space. The painting well represents the late style of Andrea.
./images/636.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Oil on wood	The detail represents the figure of St Roch.
./images/637.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Oil on canvas	"In this painting Andrea del Sarto appears to reflect on an archaising iconography in the style of Fra Bartolomeo. The figure is large and dominant, yet the proportions between the masses and the space are accurate. Even the extended spreading of the colours seems intended to lighten the weight of the figure, which due to the faint and uncertain light stands alone and isolated against the background surroundings.It is the standard of the Compagnia di San Jacopo del Nicchio. The two children wear the costume of the ""battuti"". It is a late work and very beautiful.The painting was restored in 1989."
./images/638.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Fresco	"Returning to the quarter of the SS. Annunziata after the plague, in 1525 Andrea painted one of his most celebrated works in the great cloister, known as the ""Chiostro dei morti"". It is considered to be the ultimate masterpiece of Andrea del Sarto's classicism. The solemn equilibrium, the quality of repose and grandeur, the supreme elegance of this scene illustrating the Rest during the Flight into Egypt, classically framed by the high step and the two pilasters, but laid out in an unconventional manner, make this fresco one of the loftiest achievements of the late phase of Andrea's art. The influence of Michelangelo (a number of figures on the vault of the Sistine Chapel are mentioned as prototypes) are elements in a language which is totally personal, powerful and mature."
./images/639.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Oil on wood	
./images/640.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Oil on wood	The painting was mentioned by Vasari as being the lunette of a picture which, after various wanderings passed to the museum of Berlin and was destroyed there in the Second World War. It had in fact the form of a lunette and was transformed to a rectangle at an unknown period. It is a late painting of Andrea.In a supremely poetic range of changing colours, from yellow to pink to lilac to purple, it expresses Andrea's new taste, no longer favouring the intense and highly charged palette of the preceding years; he now chooses delicate harmonies, without dissonances, and of precious and refined accords which give the composition a new balance, more quiet and refined than before.
./images/641.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Oil on wood	The detail shows the Archangel Gabriel. The night-blue drapery at the corner was added later to what was originally a lunette crowning an altarpiece.

At Barbizon he was tutored by Grigorescu. he exhibited small landscapes in the 1879, 1880 and 1881 Paris Salons.Andreescu's pictures tend to suggest fresh delight in the beauty of Nature, relish of its colours. He was forever trying to create fresh, harmonious art out of what he saw. The rich colours of grass, foliage, rocks, and sky, and the structural appearance of trees in the woods at Fontainebleau, exerted a continual attraction.

./images/669.jpg	ANDREOLI, Giorgio	Tin-glazed earthenware	The dish is signed and dated on the reverse. The decoration is taken from three engravings, one after Raphael.Born near Lake Maggiore in the late 1470s, Giorgio di Pietro Andreoli moved to Gubbio in central Italy around 1490, where he founded and directed his own maiolica workshop. Because of his great skill in the difficult luster technique, Andreoli was frequently hired to embellish the wares of other workshops, an unusual practice. After adorning these works of other masters, he often signed the pieces himself. So famous did he become that the Duke of Urbino granted him citizenship and exempted him from paying taxes and duties.
./images/670.jpg	ANDREOLI, Giorgio	Lustred tin-glazed earthenware	The picture on the dish is a rare illustration of the myth of Cyparissus from Ovid's Metamorphoses, arranged within a Mediterranean landscape. The composition is comprised of three crucial moments from the fable culminating with Cyparissus's metamorphosis into a cypress tree at bottom left.Beginning around 1490, Giorgio Andreoli directed a maiolica workshop in the town of Gubbio in Central Italy. A favourite of the Duke of Urbino as well as Pope Leo X, Maestro Giorgio was renowned for his unusual lustre technique that applied additional metallic colourings prior to the second firing, thus enriching and enlivening each piece's vibrancy.

./images/685.jpg	ANGELI, Giuseppe	Fresco	The villa of the Widmann family stands along the banks of the Brenta River near Mira. The existing structure is the result of a reconstruction carried out in 1719. In the 1750s, the interior of the villa was modified by creating a central hall, a ballroom, the height of the two preexisting floors and providing it with a balcony that circles the entire perimeter. The pictorial decoration of this room is the work of Giuseppe Angeli.The decoration of the ballroom cover the entire wall surface, the intricate trompe-l'oeil architecture, attributed to Francesco Zanchi (active 1734-1772), is especially significant, in some areas even tends to reduce the space reserved for the figure painter. The overall effect is grandiose and highly refined.The two large scenes that extend between the doors on the walls are taken from Greek mythology and depict The Sacrifice of Iphigenia and The Abduction of Helen.
./images/686.jpg	ANGELI, Giuseppe	Fresco	The two large scenes that extend between the doors on the walls in the ballroom are taken from Greek mythology and depict The Sacrifice of Iphigenia and The Abduction of Helen.The Sacrifice of Iphigenia shows the moment when the priest is about to inflict the mortal knife blow upon Agamemnon's young daughter, who is condemned to be sacrificed to Diana to atone for the insult to the goddess caused by Agamemnon, who killed her sacred stag during a hunt.

In the centre the Virgin and Child enthroned with eight angels is depicted, while on the left part St Thomas of Aquino and St Barnaba, on the right St Dominic and St Peter the Martyr are represented (not seen in this detail). The seven pictures of the predella now are in the National Gallery in London.The eight angels in front, beside, and behind her create the space in which the Virgin sits. The Virgin's gown falls in a restrained manner, her head inclined to one side. The plump cheeks and closely curled hair of Christ and the angels owe much to the manner of Gentile da Fabriano, exponent of the fourteenth-century International Gothic style, who was the dominant painter in Florence during his stay there from 1422 to 1425/6.

./images/705.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera and gold on panel	The San Domenico Altarpiece at Fiesole adorned the high altar, located in the choir, where the friars sang hymns as they celebrated the Divine Office. Only the friars would have been privileged to view the predella in all its detail, as they knelt before the altarpiece. Nearly 300 miniature angels, Old Testament prophets, New Testament saints and Dominican worthies are identified by their distinctive features, attributes and garments as well as by inscriptions. The figures turn toward the central panel, where the resurrected Christ ascends heavenward among throngs of angels acclaiming his majesty with music and prayer.The predella is now separated from the altarpiece and exhibited in the National Gallery, London.

./images/711.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera and gold on panel	This panel, which probably originally belonged to the San Domenico altarpiece. It is assumed that it represents John Chrysostom (ca. 347-407), one of the early Greek Fathers of the Church, the archbishop of Constantinople.
./images/712.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera on wood	The Annunciation (154 x 194 cm) is the main painting on the altarpiece known as the Prado Altarpiece. There are five small (23 x 35 cm each) predella pictures below the Annunciation, painted on the same panel, depicting the story of the Virgin. The altarpiece, and especially the predella paintings are of extremely high quality thus without any doubts they are the works of Fra Angelico. The central image repeats a design Fra Angelico also used in an Annunciation in Cortona and in another at the head of the stairs to the dormitory of his monastery, San Marco in Florence. The new Renaissance command of architectural perspective accompanies a continuing medieval delight in the lavish use of gilding.The painting comes from the Church of San Domenico in Fiesole, it was sold and taken to Spain in 1611.

./images/718.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera on panel	The Arte de' Linaiuoli, the Guild of Linen Manufacturers, commissioned this altarpiece from Angelico in 1432, for the Residenza of the Guild in the Piazza Sant' Andrea in Florence. The mammoth marble frame, 520 cm high and 270 cm wide, was designed by Ghiberti and executed by three craftsmen in his workshop. It is firmly classical, with round arch, dental cornice, and pediment.On the outside of the doors are two monumental and statuesque figures: St Mark and St Peter. Both stand on flat but irregularly edged rocks. The background is dark and unarticulated: there is no attempt to claim it for the picture space. St Mark's lion crouches behind his right leg. St Peter holds his key and gazes heavenwards.
./images/719.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera on panel	The doors of the triptych open to reveal the Virgin and Child Enthroned with St John the Baptist and St Mark. The two saints have the same three-dimensional qualities as their companions on the outside of the triptych. St John the Baptist is shown with his right arm curved round and up across his chest and left shoulder, and the top of his cross pushed back away from the viewer. The right foot is to the fore. The extended hand of St Mark on the Virgin's right draws the eye into the space occupied by the figure.The central panel of The Virgin and Child differs from its predecessors in Angelico's oeuvre in the absence of a circle of space-defining angels. Greater realism is achieved by translating part of the traditional gold background into elaborate golden curtains which frame the Virgin, the outline thus created echoing a pointed arch. She has the same solidity and three-dimensional qualities as the saints in the work. The Child is clothed and stands upright holding His arms out in blessing. He lacks the overtly puerile qualities of many infant Christ's of the Renaissance and as a result appears medieval or Byzantine.
./images/720.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera on panel	St John the Baptist is depicted on the left wing of the Linaioli tabernacle, while on the right wing St John the Evangelist can be seen. These two figures form part of a work that in 1433 opened the way to a new horizon for early renaissance religious painting.

./images/722.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera on wood	The altarpiece called Linaioli Tabernacle was executed for the Arte dei Linaioli (Guild of Flaxmakers). The central panel depicting the Madonna and the Child is surrounded by a band of 20 cm width which contains 12 angels playing different musical instruments. This band can be seen only when the tabernacle is open. These angels are among the most famous and most popular paintings of Fra Angelico.

./images/727.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera on panel	Elevated in the deep azure sky and surrounded by concentric rings of cherubim and angels, Christ sits on a glowing bank of clouds as he judges the world. He is flanked by the interceding figures of John the Baptist and the Virgin. Rows of saints and prophets, identified by their distinctive attributes, varied expressions and brilliantly coloured mantles, sit suspended on clouds in the heavens. A long row of tombs leads to the distant horizon, bisecting the valley below. To the right of Christ, the Blessed kneel in adoration, their faces radiant with the love of God, as angels dance in a circle in the verdant vegetation of Paradise. Golden rays of light stream through the open gates of the City of God and illuminate the white gowns of the Blessed seeking entry. To Christ's left, demons with pitchforks drive the agonized Damned into the mouth of a mountainous Hell. The ghastly torments that await them are portrayed within its flaming circles, where naked sinners, some strangled with snakes, suffer for their transgressions.The abundance of figures (270 in all), nuanced evocation of their emotions, descending perspective of the row of tombs and ascending landscape reveal a mastery of narrative and space that was unprecedented in Angelico's small-scale works.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 8 minutes):Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart: Requiem K 626: Dies irae

./images/731.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera on panel	The large receding rectangle of empty tombs creates the depth in the bottom half of this picture. An empty sarcophagus laid across it in the foreground subtly reduces the emphasis on this axis. Originally forming part of a seat, the complete picture extends to either side to show paradise and hell, but these scenes are thought to be by Angelico's workshop. Beside the empty tombs stand the judged; the saved with radiant heads exit left to paradise; and demons drive the nimbus-less damned to the right, down to hell.In the upper part of the panel Christ sits in jjudgment in a mandorla framed by a border of angels. On his right is the Virgin and on his left St John the Baptist. Beyond them on each side are two tiers of seated apostles and saints. The spatial depth of the terrestrial part of the picture is not maintained in the celestial half, the slight angling of the two banks of saints failing to give heaven the same illusion of depth.
./images/732.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera on panel	The detail shows the Hell from the right side of the painting.
./images/733.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera on wood	The painting is a repetition of the main panel of the Prado Altarpiece in a more refined architectural setting. The altarpiece is the work of Fra Angelico with an intervention of his collaborators only in the predella pictures.
./images/734.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera on wood	In a loggia of columns and arches, the angel appears to Mary. Shown in profile, he occupies the larger part of the painting, his richly painted wings extending out through the colonnade, their upper tips marking the centre of the picture. He declaims to the Virgin, 'the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee' (Luke 1, v. 35). She, demure, with a dove fluttering above her head in a burst of golden light, inclines towards him and responds, 'Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word' (Luke 1, v. 38). Beyond them the picture space extends into the Virgin's chamber, and further, hidden space is hinted at by the bed curtain there which serves also to set off Gabriel's nimbus.Outside the loggia is a delicately painted garden, enclosed by a palisade, symbolic of Mary's virginity. Carved in a roundel above the centre column is a half-length effigy of Isaiah, who had prophesied the birth of a child to a virgin. The pink entablature of the loggia points to the second reference to the Old Testament, in the top left corner, where Adam and Eve are expelled from Paradise.Undoubtedly Angelico's first truly great painting, this Annunciation formed a prototype for a noble line of derivatives.

./images/738.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera on wood	In the predella below the Annunciation, near the two farthest edges, two scenes are painted. The first represent the Birth of the Virgin, the other The Virgin Consigns the Habit to St Dominic. There are five central scenes of the life of the Virgin, one after the other without interruption, namely (from the left).

Marriage of the Virgin, The Visitation, Adoration of the Magi, Presentation of Jesus at the Temple, Death of the Virgin.This picture shows the scene of the Visitation. The event shown here is described in the Gospel of Luke. Immediately following the Annunciation, Mary 'went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Juda; and entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth' (Luke 1, v. 39-40). The Virgin and Elisabeth embrace, the straight folds of their gowns showing a simplicity and reserve alien to the curvilinear trecento influences of some ofAngelico's mentors and contemporaries. Elisabeth, six months pregnant with John the Baptist, is given a wider girth than her cousin. Juda is represented by a series of simple, geometric forms, sharply lit but slightly thin and awkward. A woman makes her way up the hill path which lies in shadow below her. Behind her the sky and earth meet in the haze of a Tuscan summer.This is the first identifiable landscape in Italian art. In the middle distance a lake, which no longer exists, spreads out in the Chiana Valley; beyond rises the town of Castigliona Florentino, and further distant the tower of Monterchi.

./images/745.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera and gold on panel	This polyptych, as shown by the recent restoration work, emerges from the combination of three wood panels of which it is formed, put together with the upper part and the border below. Therefore the three works must have been painted at different times and for different reasons. On the top are represented the Annunciation and the Crucifixion. In the middle of the polyptych there is a Virgin and Child. On the left Sts John the Baptist and John the Evangelist, while on the right Sts Matthew and Mary Magdalen are represented. On the predella episodes from the life of St Dominic, and other images of saints and angels are represented.Art critics tend to date the older wood painting, the one with the Virgin, to 1434 and the complete work to 1437.The triptych was placed on a lateral altar in the church of St Dominic in Cortona. At the beginning of the Second World War it was immured in the belfry where the wood suffered much damage due to humidity and temperatures. It was necessary to detach the painted surface and transfer it to a new base. It has been restored after many succeeding interventions. Unfortunately, it has lost its original solidity and need continuous reexamination.
./images/746.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera and gold on panel	This Madonna with the Child and Angels is the central part of the altarpiece called Cortona Triptych. On the left panel St John the Evangelist and St John the Baptist, on the right panel St Mark and St Mary Magdalen are depicted. The ten predella pictures show episodes of the life of Saint Dominic and standing figures of saints. The altarpiece was damaged during the second World War and restored in 1946-50.

./images/754.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera and gold on panel	On the predella, beautifully painted in miniature, episodes from the life of St Dominic, and other images of saints and angels are represented.In the centre the predella continues with a representation of St Michael Archangel, then the scenes healing of Napoleone Orsini, dispute of St Dominic and a representation of St Vincent.
./images/755.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera and gold on panel	On the predella, beautifully painted in miniature, episodes from the life of St Dominic, and other images of saints and angels are represented.On the right side of the predella we can see the scenes of the angels serve dinner to the friars, the death of St Dominic, and, finally a representation of St Thomas Aquinas.
./images/756.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera and gold on panel	The picture shows the Perugia Altarpiece in a modern, early twentieth-century frame. The left and centre predella panels are copies of originals now in the Pinacoteca, Vatican.The altarpiece is one of Angelico's most beautiful paintings. Until recently it was believed that its patron was Benedetto Guidalotti (1388-1429), archbishop of Recanati. New research, however, indicates instead that his sister Elisabetta (died 1460) may have been responsible for the project. Prominently located in the transept of San Domenico, the triptych conveyed the devotion of the Guidalotti to the Virgin and the saints worshipped in the church. The diverse saints on the pilasters, almost all bearing books, reflect the commitment to scholarship by the Order that shared by the Guidalotti.The triptych was completely dismembered nearly two centuries ago, when its frame was destroyed, the panels cut apart and the predella dispersed.
./images/757.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera and gold on panel	The picture shows the Perugia polyptych, without the complete predella.
./images/758.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera and gold on panel	This panel, representing the Virgin and Child Enthroned with Four Angels, was at the centre of a polyptych painted for the St Nicholas chapel in the church of San Domenico at Perugia. The side panels represent St Dominic and St Nicholas of Bari, as well as St John the Baptist and St Catherine of Alexandria. The work is now displayed without its original frame, and the area which this covered can easily be seen along the upper edge of the panel. Compared with the Linaiuoli altarpiece, this Virgin is less monumental and the Child altogether more sinuous and fleshy. Angelico returns to the circle of angels to create an additional sense of depth, but here the two who would have stood forward of the throne have been replaced by three vases of flowers. The Virgin's throne is a solid classical affair with round arch and pilasters, topped with a swagged frieze. The background of the panel is still gold and abstract.
./images/759.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera and gold on panel	St Dominic and St Nicholas of Bari stand to the Virgin's right. They lack the sculptural monumentality of the saints in the Linaiuoli altarpiece, are lit in a softer and more diffuse manner, and are not made to stand in a darkened niche. Here, for the first time Angelico breaks away from the convention of the abstract, all-surrounding gold, and places the figures in front of a long table, whose end can be seen behind St Nicholas of Bari who has placed his mitre on it. This is not, however, so great a departure from convention as might be implied, as the table is covered with a golden cloth and beyond it is the usual gold background.The two figures stand at the very front of the space created, St Dominic's foot and St Nicholas's vestments touching the edge of the step. St Nicholas wears his bishop's cope and supports his crook, while at his feet are three full leather bags. These refer to the most popular legend concerning this fourth-century churchman. He reputedly tossed bags of gold through the open window of a house, providing the three women who lived within with dowries and thus saving them from turning to prostitution. The event is shown, with two other scenes from the saint's life, in one of the predella panels from the altarpiece.
./images/760.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera and gold on panel	St John the Baptist and St Catherine of Alexandria stand at the edge of the step and, like their companion saints in the altarpiece, have a table running behind them. St John's cross is tucked nonchalantly behind his halo and the base of it sticks right forward, but neither this nor his foreshortened hand recreate the impression of three-dimensionality with which he was rendered in the Linaiuoli altarpiece. He holds a scroll with a quotation from his own words, 'Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world', (John 1, v. 29). St Catherine has fewer sculptural qualities still. Beside her is a broken wheel from the diabolical machine on which she was tested. Some critics see the hand of assistants, rather than primarily that of the master, in these two figures.
./images/761.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera and gold on panel	The large altarpiece, called Perugia Triptych and executed for the Cappella di San Niccolò of the church San Domenico at Perugia, contained three main panels, a predella with three pictures, and two decorated side pilasters. It was dismembered in later centeries. The majority of the parts are in the Galleria Nazionale dell'Umbria at Perugia, while two of the predella paintings are in the Vatican.The central part of the triptych represents the Madonna with the Child and Angels, while on the side parts four saints are shown. The predella depicts the story of St Nicholas.The first predella painting (this picture) shows the birth of St Nicholas (on the left), The Vocation of St Nicholas (in the center) and the Giving Dowry to Three Poor Girls (on the right).This scene refers to the most popular legend concerning this fourth-century churchman. He reputedly tossed bags of gold through the open window of a house, providing the three women who lived within with dowries and thus saving them from turning to prostitution. The event is shown, with two other scenes from the saint's life, in one of the predella panels from the altarpiece.

./images/770.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera on wood	This is the main painting of the altarpiece, called San Marco Altarpiece. It represents the Virgin and Child Enthroned with Angels and Saints, it was executed for the main altar of the church belonging to the Convent of San Marco and dedicated to the two medical saints, Cosmas and Damian.The altarpiece, one of the most grandiose of the Quattrocento altars,  was executed after the decision of Cosimo de' Medici in 1438 to transfer to Cortona the triptych which served as main altar of the convent church. It depicts, in the front, the kneeling Sts Cosmas and Damian, then in the second row, from the left: Sts Lawrence, John the Evangelist, Mark, Dominic, Francis and Peter the Martyr. It is assumed that the figure of St Cosmas is the likeness of Cosimo de' Medici. In the lower center a Crucifixion with golden background can be seen.
./images/771.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera on wood	
./images/772.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera and gold on panel	The predella of the San Marco Altarpiece contained scenes from the lives of Sts Cosmas and Damian. According to the reconstruction, the predella consisted of seven frontal and two lateral panels. The narratives that extended continuously across the foot of the altarpiece were conceived with great imagination as well as geometric rigour.On this picture, which was placed on the left lateral side of the predella, two consecutive episodes are shown. On the left the two Arab physicians effect a miraculous cure; on the right Saint Damian, contrary to his vows, unwillingly accepts a gift.

The undulating forms of the landscape recede and flatten as they approach the horizon, itself dissolved in the mist of atmospheric perspective. The figures are more intensely characterized through their varied ages, garments, postures and expressions.

./images/776.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera on wood	This panel was part of the altarpiece of the main altar in the monastery church of San Marco, Florence, and was originally in the middle of its predella.The centre predella panel of the San Marco altarpiece is not overtly connected to the scenes on either side of it, which show the life of Sts Cosmas and Damian, although it too is lit from the right. Instead it relates directly to the crucifixion at the base of the altarpiece which, when the predella was in situ, was immediately above it. Christ's body is supported by Nicodemus, and his hands are held and kissed by the stooping Virgin and St John. Christ has a weightless air about him, so that the three other figures appear to have to do little to support him. The winding cloth lies stretched out in a receding rectangle creating the foreground space, its folds and colour echoing the white rock. Behind lies the dark rectangular void of the tomb. The sparsity and simplicity of the composition, the firmly closed-off space and the extensive use of white in this panel, are all also found in Angelico's frescoes at San Marco.The figures here, arranged parallel with each other, with the central perspective of the shroud leading to the tomb, shows a very different idea of spatial organization from that inRogier van der Weyden's panelof the same subject.

./images/778.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera on wood	This picture is the second from the right on the predella. The legend of Sts Cosmas and Damian, twin brothers who were famed for making no charges for their services as physicians, is outlined in the predella panels of this San Marco altarpiece. Several attempts to put them to death failed, until the last, pictured here. The final moments of the two brothers are shown set against one of Angelico's finest landscapes. Outside a town with fortifications akin to those of Jerusalem in his Deposition, the two saints wait to join the three headless figures in the foreground. The greatest emphasis falls on the one who kneels directly in front of a row of five cypresses which runs parallel to the picture plane. The trees can be taken to symbolize the five being executed.
./images/779.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera on wood	This picture is the first from the right on the predella.
./images/780.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera on wood	This picture was placed on the right lateral side of the predella. Justinian sleeps while Sts Cosmas and Damian enter his chamber trailing patches of soft cloud. They replace his corrupted leg with a healthy one. The room is Spartan but the variety of light-sources and Angelico's close observation give it interest. Light floods in from outside through the window on the left, illuminating its own frame and parts of the swags of curtain. Exterior space is indicated not only by the window but by the door opposite it, from whence comes more light. From the front left outside the picture comes the third source of light, which produces a broad diagonal sweep across the right wall. The curtain provides the rectangular backdrop parallel to the picture surface which is common to each of these predella panels, and also hints at more, obscured space behind it. The container hanging from a nail on the side of the bed, the glass and decanter, the slippers and the simple three-legged stool, all provide the constituents of a closely observed still-life.

./images/787.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera on panel	This work was originally commissioned by Palla Strozzi from Lorenzo Monaco, for the sacristy of the church of Santa Trinità in Florence, but by the time of Monaco's death only the pinnacles of this work had been painted. When Angelico took over the commission he found himself cribbed and confined by Monaco's ready-made triple-arched Gothic frame. He ignored these constraints, however, making skilful use of the three arches in his composition to provide a scene of stunning beauty and subdued yet poignant emotion, set in an expansive Tuscan landscape. Although the work is painted on one panel, the three arches of the frame find an echo in the placing of the figures in three groups.The central arch is largely blocked off by the wooden framework of the cross and two ladders. The cross bar of the former appears to run behind the picture frame hinting at further, obscured space. With no scene behind but the sky and the lattice work of timber, the eye is drawn to the body of Christ which is at the very centre of the picture. Angelico challenges the tendency of the other two arches to define the shape and space of the work by placing a strong vertical, in the form of a tower or a tree, in the corners of each. The pilasters on either side of the frame contain twelve panels with full length portraits of saints, and eight medallions with portrait busts. The full-length figures are shown standing on columns which are each painted with careful attention to the view-point of the spectator.
./images/788.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera on wood	
./images/789.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera on panel	The cross has no upper limb, thereby blunting the pointedness of the arch behind which it stands. There is room at the top only for a view of the mocking panel which declares Christ King of the Jews. Christ is covered with the weals of the flagellation, and blood trickles from the lance wound in his side. More blood runs down the cross to the rock at the base, a stylized representation of Golgotha. Christ's head lies almost horizontally, his passive face marked only by thin dribbles of blood from the pricks of the crown of thorns.Vasari claims that one of the figures lowering Christ is a portrait of Michelozzo, the architect responsible for the rebuilding of the convent of San Marco in Florence. Pope-Hennessy suggests that if he is represented at all it is in the figure under Christ's right arm wearing a black cappucio, or monastic hood.
./images/790.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera on panel	In the distance at the top left lies Jerusalem, shown by Angelico as a sparkling Tuscan hill town. The city fortifications appear as a series of cubes, pillars, and walls massed together in a sharply defining light. Buildings of widely varying sizes, shapes and colours are arranged together within the city walls. At the top of the hill rises a citadel-like temple. Outside the city gates lies a landscape of ploughed fields, farmhouses, and hedgerows. In the sky, above a storm cloud is gathering which throws shadow over half the city. The whole is viewed through a screen of trees, which mark out the middle distance in the complete picture.
./images/791.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera on panel	In this detail the towered buildings confirm the landscape as Italian. The hills stretch out into the distance, softened and smoothed by the light, peppered with gleaming villages and farmhouses. The foreground rocks are insufficiently distant to be mellowed, and are shown with all their facets and angularity. A row of trees again screens the landscape, emphasizing its distance.
./images/792.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera on panel	Angelico stops short of portraying the figures lamenting Christ's death in the agonies of grief; instead he shows them in languorous contemplation of their inner sorrow. Mary Magdalen kneels before Christ, taking his feet in her hands and kissing them. The Virgin kneels, her hands clasped, head on one side in reflective misery, with an air of particular detachment. She is partly screened from the viewer by the winding sheet held before her. The other holy women stand in positions of contemplation or prayer; one wipes a tear from her eye. As in earlier paintings by Angelico, the sense of the space in which the Virgin kneels is created by placing figures in a circle around her. In the background the road begins to wind its way up to Jerusalem.
./images/793.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera on panel	Kneeling in the foreground of the picture is a Beato. He echoes the Magdalen in his position, pose and red gown. A foreshortened arm extends out towards the viewer, drawing us into the scene before us. It has been suggested that this figure is Alessio degli Strozzi, the dead son of the family whose patronage brought about the creation of the work. Behind him are five men, standing further forward in the picture plane than the women on the other side whom they balance. Like the women each is contemplative, reticent and mournful. One displays to the others some of the instruments of crucifixion: three gruesomely large nails with heavy drips of blood on them, and the neatly woven circlet of thorns whose perforations can be seen on Christ's brow. Beneath their feet, indicative of Angelico's enjoyment of the portrayal of nature, is the richly leafed and flowered turf which is common to so many of his paintings.
./images/794.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera on wood	This detail demonstrates Fra Angelico's skillful treatment of landscapes.
./images/795.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera on wood	Fra Angelico's Deposition demonstrates not only his skillful treatment of landscapes, but also figures, to which he often gave specific and presumably identifiable features. The man in the turban is likely a portrait of a person known to the artist.
./images/796.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Fresco	This is the fresco on the wall of Cell 1 of the Convento di San Marco in Florence.The brilliance of the early morning is real enough, but the irradiating light, the floating rather than walking figure of Christ, the wealth of natural detail in the garden, are for devotional reasons and intended  to stimulate the meditation of the monk who lived in the cell.
./images/797.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Fresco	This is the fresco on the wall of Cell 2 of the Convento di San Marco in Florence. It is one of the first frescoes in the convent.
./images/798.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Fresco	The picture shows a view of Cell 3 of the Convento di San Marco in Florence. The fresco on the wall depicts the scene of the Annunciation with a standing angel and a kneeling Virgin, slight and frail, who holds her open book to her breast.
./images/799.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Fresco	This is the fresco on the wall of Cell 3 of the Convento di San Marco in Florence.On the left St Peter the Martyr is represented. This is a favourite theme, here simplified. A contribution of Angelico's pupils can be assumed.The composition of this fresco is severe in the extreme. The Virgin inhabits not a house but a cell as Spartan as that in which the fresco is painted, and beyond Gabriel and Mary the eye meets only a plain blank wall. The one piece of decoration, the capital of the column, is deliberately obscured by the wing of the angel. Here and throughout the series the pallet is extremely restrained, as if Angelico thought rich and varied colours were as likely as decoration to distract the friars from spiritual contemplation.
./images/800.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Fresco	This is the fresco on the wall of Cell 5 of the Convento di San Marco in Florence.The represented saints are St Catherine of Alexandria and St Peter the Martyr. It is partly attributed to the school of Fra Angelico.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 22 minutes):Thomas Tallis: Mass (Puer natus est)
./images/801.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Fresco	This is the fresco on the wall of Cell 6 of the Convento di San Marco in Florence.In this fresco Christ stands on a rock, prefiguring his rising from the tomb. His arms are outstretched and in this He also foreshadows his own crucifixion. He is voluminously clad in a sculptural mass of glowing white robe, and encircling Him is a radiant white mandorla. His forward gaze does not directly engage the eye of the spectator. At the base of the rock three of the Apostles crouch in awed positions, but they maintain the curious contemplative detachment from the drama of the scene which is the hallmark of this fresco cycle.At the edge of the fresco, on either side, stand the Virgin and St Dominic in positions indicative of prayer, stern and unresponsive to events around them. The heads of Moses and Elias appear beneath the arms of Christ; they are introduced as detached symbols to aid meditation. There is no attempt to create any more than the bare essentials of picture space; this particular spur to devotion required no more. For Angelico, too elaborate a spatial framework as much as excessive use of colour, decoration, or narrative, could detract from the picture's power.
./images/802.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Fresco	This is the fresco on the wall of Cell 7 of the Convento di San Marco in Florence.The contemplative restraint of the San Marco frescoes is nowhere better illustrated than in The Mocking of Christ. Rather than paint Christ's humiliations in their full violence in a complex narrative work, they are reduced to a series of iconographic symbols. In doing this Angelico was drawing on established trecento precedents.In a plain-walled room Christ sits on a dais in a luminous white robe and tunic. The great slab of white marble beneath Him adds to the air of radiant whiteness surrounding Him. He is blindfolded, with a crown of thorns about his head. Behind Him hanging from a plain frieze is a screen on which are painted the emblems of his indignities: the head of the spitting soldier, the hands of the buffeters, the hand and stick forcing the thorns down on his head. On a low step at the front of the picture sit the Virgin and St Dominic. Neither regard Christ but sit with their backs turned towards him in poses of intense meditation - the depth of meditation that the frescoes were designed to assist each friar to attain.Fra Angelico was assisted by Benozzo Gozzoli in the execution of this fresco.
./images/803.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Fresco	This is the fresco on the wall of Cell 8 of the Convento di San Marco in Florence.On the left, St Dominic in meditation. Thethree women on the rightwere painted by Benozzo Gozzoli who that time was an apprentice in the workshop of Fra Angelico. He collaborated in the pictorial decoration of the Dominican convent of San Marco.
./images/804.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Fresco	This is the fresco on the wall of Cell 9 of the Convento di San Marco in Florence.The glory of St Mary, a theme dear to Angelico is acclaimed by six kneeling saints. The saints represented on the lower part are (from the left) St Thomas, St Benedict, St Dominic, St Francis, St Peter the Martyr and St Mark. The fresco probably belongs to the first ones executed in the Convent by Fra Angelico.These six saints can be seen as a token representation of the elect, who surround Christ and the Virgin in heaven in the traditional rendering of this scene. But like so many other figures in the series of San Marco frescoes, they have an air of detachment from the events to which they are nominally witnesses. They hold their hands out in adoration and gaze heavenwards, but none looks directly at the scene of coronation. The Virgin, with her arms folded over her chest, leans forward to receive the crown. She is seated beside Christ, in accordance with the usual composition for this subject.In this series of frescoes at San Marco Angelico has not turned back to medieval prototypes but instead, through economy in the use of figures, restraint in the overt expression of emotion, and austere use of colour, he has created his own meditative images of remarkable force.
./images/805.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Fresco	This is the fresco on the wall of Cell 10 of the Convento di San Marco in Florence: St Peter Martyr and the Blessed Villana of the Dominican Order contemplate the three other figures of the Evangelical story.Along with his assistants, Fra Angelico decorated the vast convent of San Marco with frescoes. For the more public rooms, the painter produced rather festive and elaborate representations, but for the private cells where the paintings were the objects of the monks' contemplation, the frescoes were more spare and ethereal, painted with restrained colour.
./images/806.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Fresco	This is the fresco on the wall of Cell 17 of the Convento di San Marco in Florence.Over the course of the commission for decoration of the dormitory, Fra Angelico's direct participation in painting the frescoes seems to have diminished, while that of Benozzo Gozzoli and his other assistants increased. This is especially evident in the images of the Crucifixion with St Dominic in the novices' cells 17 an 20 of the south corridor, on which construction began in 1441. The frescoes were completed in only two days each. They seem to have been painted almost entirely by Benozzo Gozzoli, as is evident in the linear description of Christ's idealized anatomy, especially his ribcage, and the uninflected modelling of Dominic's habit.

This is especially evident in the images of the Crucifixion with St Dominic in the novices' cells 17 an 20 of the south corridor, which seem to have been painted almost entirely by Benozzo Gozzoli. Other artists seem to have executed several frescoes along the east corridor, as suggested by the somewhat awkward postures and gestures of the figures, the unmodulated contours and flat colours. An example of these can be seen in Cell 25.
./images/809.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Fresco	This is the fresco on the wall of Cell 31 of the Convento di San Marco in Florence.In contrast to most frescoes in the cells of the friars and novices, those in the corridor of the lay brethren are illustrative narratives that closely follow the Gospel of Matthew. These portrayals were directed to a community that was less attuned to theological and visual abstraction. Many of the scenes are situated in mountainous landscapes or detailed architectural settings. In Christ in Limbo, scaly demons hide in the rocky fissures of Purgatory while the faithful escape the darkness of Limbo to rush toward the resurrected Christ.The contribution of an assistant can be assumed in the execution of this fresco.
./images/810.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Fresco	This is the fresco on the wall of Cell 35 of the Convento di San Marco in Florence.In contrast to most frescoes in the cells of the friars and novices, those in the corridor of the lay brethren are illustrative narratives that closely follow the Gospel of Matthew. These portrayals were directed to a community that was less attuned to theological and visual abstraction. Many of the scenes are situated in mountainous landscapes or detailed architectural settings. The Institute of the Eucharist in Cell 35 underscored the Dominicans devotion to the Eucharist, which St Thomas articulated most eloquently in composing the office for the feast of Corpus Domini. It transpires in a spacious room similar to the convent's actual refectory and repeats elements of San Marco's own architecture - the arched windows of the dormitory, the well in the second cloister - to emphasize its relevance to the lay brother.This fresco was executed by an assistant of Fra Angelico.
./images/811.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Fresco	This is the fresco on the wall of Cell 36 of the Convento di San Marco in Florence.The Crucifixion is depicted in seven cells in the corridor for lay brothers. While the friars and novices may have been moved to prayer at the thought or sight of the crucified Christ, the lay brothers required more direction in imagining the Passion. By incorporating more narrative elements, these images were able to prompt their devotion more efficaciously. In Cell 36, Roman soldiers mount ladders to nail Christ to the cross, below which the grieving Virgin and Magdalene stand as Sanhedrin look on.The contribution of an assistant can be assumed in the execution of this fresco.
./images/812.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Fresco	This is the fresco on the wall of Cell 37 of the Convento di San Marco in Florence.The Crucifixion is depicted in seven cells in the corridor for lay brothers. While the friars and novices may have been moved to prayer at the thought or sight of the crucified Christ, the lay brothers required more direction in imagining the Passion. By incorporating more narrative elements, these images were able to prompt their devotion more efficaciously. In six cells Fra Angelico included the grieving Virgin and other mourners along with St Dominic or Peter martyr to cue the beholder's response. So it was in Cell 37, the large size of which suggests it may have served as the Chapter Room for the lay brothers as they met each day under the guidance of their own prior.The contribution of an assistant can be assumed in the execution of this fresco.
./images/813.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Fresco	This is the fresco on the wall of Cell 38 of the Convento di San Marco in Florence.One cell at the end of the corridor for lay brothers was distinguished by its occupant and size. It was intended for Cosimo de' Medici, who belonged to the community by virtue of his patronage. His room, in fact, was a double cell (Cells 38 and 39), in which the superimposed chambers were joined by a short flight of stairs. Of all the cells along this corridor, Cosimo's was the most spacious and elaborately decorated. On the entrance wall of the lower room (Cell 38) Fra Angelico painted the crucified Christ against a ground of costly lapis lazuli, rather than the bare plaster background found in the other cells. The inscribed haloes identify the saints kneeling alongside the Virgin as Cosmas, Peter martyr and John the Evangelist, protectors of Cosimo, his oldest son, and his father, Giovanni di Bicci.The Adoration of the Magi and the image of Christ as Man of Sorrows in the recessed tabernacle below met Cosimo's gaze once he ascended the stairs to Cell 39. Benozzo Gozzoli, whose style closely resembled that of Angelico, and an assistant painted these frescoes, as shown by the slightly awkward stance and proportions of some of the figures as well as by their linear, closely spaced facial features.

./images/815.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	-	The Medici chose the rising architect, Michelozzo di Bartolomeo to rebuild San Marco. The restoration proceeded with remarkable speed. The twenty cells of the east corridor of the dormitory were built between late 1437 and 1438, when renovation of the church was begun. Reconstruction continued sequentially, from the north corridor for lay brothers and guests (1440-41) to the south for the novices (completed in 1442).
./images/816.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Fresco	This fresco is situated on the wall of the northern corridor on the upper floor in front of the staircase in the Convento di San Marco in Florence. It was painted on Angelico's return from Rome in 1450, and is therefore several years later than the majority of the frescoes at San Marco. In style it falls between the sparseness of The Annunciation in cell 3 and the richness of the Cortona altarpiece. Unlike in the Cortona version, the garden is here viewed through a colonnade of columns which recede to a vanishing point near the centre of the painting.Under the arches between the Corinthian columns are the slender figures of the Madonna and of the angel in devout converse, regulated with the rhythm of gentle curves; in the background, on the left, the celestial fields with Tuscan cypresses; Gabriel's wings stretch out like a rainbow. It is the theme of the tabernacles which multiply themselves at the crossing of the ways; the greeting taken from the mediaeval hymnology and the invitation addressed to the passer-by and writings under the painting show Angelico's most cultivated devotion: Salve, Mater pietatis / et totius Trinitatis / nobile triclinium / Maria!The lighting of the scene is curiously illogical, the interior of the arcaded loggia is evenly illuminated, despite the fairly strong light coming from the left.

Around the fresco, on the border, are the busts of the Prophets and Sibyls in ten hexagons; in the centre, above the Crucifixion the pelikan, symbol of the redemption. Below, in the lower frieze there are 17 medallions with portraits of the most illustrious members of the Dominican Order.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 3 minutes):Guillaume Dufay: Hymn for Easter

./images/824.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Fresco	This fresco on the wall of the east corridor of the convent is also called Madonna of the Shadows (Madonna delle Ombre).Painted in the corridor off which the brethren's cells open (between cells 25 and 26), this fresco was one of Fra Angelico's last works in San Marco's Dominican Monastery. There is almost a metaphysical feel to the frozen gestures, the deep gazes, and the strong and boldly-applied colours. This sensation is boosted by the power of the side-lighting, which in turn is emphasized by the long shadows cast by the classical capitals. These are reminiscent of architecture by Michelozzo. This fresco is the painter's ultimate achievement of wonderful synthesis between his mystical inspiration and the effective application of recent breakthroughs in Renaissance painting.
./images/825.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Fresco	"The picture shows the left side of the Madonna of the Shadows. On the left, St Dominic engages the beholder's gaze, directing it to his book. The text, which has no known source in his writings, is an exhortation to the friars: ""Have charity, preserve humility, possess voluntary poverty. I call forth God's curse and mine on the introduction of possessions into this Order."" St Dominic stands at a distance from St Mark, as well as from Sts Cosmas and Damian to whom the convent was jointly dedicated."

./images/828.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	-	The Museum of San Marco is located in the former monastery of the Dominicans, constructed by Michelozzo in 1436 on a commission from the Medici ruler Cosimo the Elder. Michelozzo here adheres firmly to the Renaissance forms of Brunelleschi, even though his classicism has none of the other's passion for archeological research in it. The smooth, flowing lines of the cloister's arches create effects of light and shade which alternate in the series of vaults. Naturally the religious function and the deliberately spiritual effect of the structure, suggested by the order's Vicar General and perhaps by Fra Angelico himself, qualify these chiaroscuro and plastic impressions. The history of San Marco is inseparably linked to the figures of the painters, Fra Angelico and Fra Bartolommeo, and the friar Girolamo Savonarola.The figure of Angelico dominates in the Convent.  The friar painter lived a long time here and expressed here his delicate and simple soul in the sincere, candid forms of art. But a great part, not only the artistic, but of the religious and civil history of Florence developed here.In the cloisters, in the dormitories, in the cells we find the conventual character well-preserved in the harmonious architectural plan. We also find the memory of San Antonino, who entered here as a friar, and, it is said on the advice of Angelico, came out of it in 1445 archbishop of Florence; and the memory of Savonarola, who came here in 1489, and was later prior of the convent and who from here raised himself against the decadence of habits calling the people to liberty and democratic arrangement; and the memory, above that of Angelico's almost unknown collaborators, of a great friar painter, Fra Bartolommeo.

These panels are actually on the inner face of the arches at the end of these walls. There eight full-length figures of saints painted on the arches. (In this view St Ambrose and, below him, St Thomas Aquinas is shown.) The chapel's wainscoting section, roughly 2,5 meters high, is painted with a wall drapery in a pomegranate design against a red background. In two spots the coat-of-arms of Pope Nicholas V appears inside a laurel wreath. The deep embrasures of the two windows present six- and seven-lobed rosettes containing alternating floral designs and portrait busts prophets and saints.
./images/834.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Fresco	The fresco cycle consists of scenes from the lives of the archdeacons Stephen (lunette) and Lawrence (bottom register).On the lunette of the west wall, St Peter, prince of the apostles, is anointing St Stephen, deacon of the church. In the smaller compartment of the lower register, between the two windows, St Sixtus is seen bestowing the same office on St Lawrence. This lunette presents a second scene of St Stephen distributing alms to the poor. The corresponding motif from the life of St Lawrence appears in the right-hand picture compartment of the north wall, above the entry.There are also two original windows on the west wall.
./images/835.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Fresco	The lunette represents two scenes: St Peter Consacrates Stephen as Deacon; St Stephen Distributing Alms.

./images/840.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Fresco	Sixtus II (257-258) had charged archdeacon Lawrence with dispersing the church's wealth to the needy. This deed aroused the ire of Emperor Valerian who had claimed the treasure for himself, and formed the basis for the charges brought against Lawrence and his eventual execution.In its setting in the Chapel of Pope Nicholas V in the Vatican, the dramatic impact of this fresco is aided by its position between two recessed windows. The scene is set in the nave of a basilica, the type of architectural space which in St Lawrence distributing Alms was used only as a backdrop. Five columns are visible on either side, and they are equalled in volume and monumentality by the bishops and other churchmen who witness St Lawrence kneeling before the Pope. The end wall of the basilica and its niche bring emphasis to no figure in the composition, for none stands at the centre. The central axis runs instead through the communion chalice which passes between the Pope and the saint.It is remarkable that in this fresco cycle the pope and the prelates wear azure vests, then rarely used and presently non-existent.
./images/841.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Fresco	The fresco cycle consists of scenes from the lives of the archdeacons Stephen (lunette) and Lawrence (bottom register).On the lunette of the north wall, St Stephen is seen preaching on the left, and on the right engaged in the dispute with the Jews that led to his condemnation. In the bottom register, St Sixtus is entrusting the church treasure to St Lawrence (left) and St Lawrence distributing alms (right, above the entrance door).
./images/842.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Fresco	The lunette represents two scenes: The Sermon of St Stephen; Dispute before the Sanhedrin.On the left St Stephen preaches to an array of figures placed throughout the vista of space. To the right, in a chamber which is also embedded in the lefthand scene yet has a different perspective framework, he addresses the council. Here the depth of the picture is truncated by a blank wall hung with a curtain.
./images/843.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Fresco	This scene is the left part of the lunette on the north wall.
./images/844.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Fresco	This scene is the right part of the lunette on the north wall.
./images/845.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Fresco	Below the lunette two scenes are represented: St Sixtus Entrusts the Church Treasures to Lawrence; St Lawrence Distributing Alms.St Lawrence, a third-century Roman who, like St Stephen, suffered a violent death for his faith, was venerated as one of the most famous martyrs of the city of Rome. This fresco panel is divided in two, without any attempt to give the neighbouring scenes any architectural or spatial cohesion. The architecture employed by Angelico in both scenes is of a distinctly Roman splendour and dignity. The two events from the life of the saint are simply told. They are rich in detail but none is superfluous to the narrative.On the left he kneels to receive the treasures of the Church from Pope St Sixtus II, who is given the features of Angelico's patron, Nicholas V. It has been suggested that the depiction of the two soldiers preparing to break open a bricked-up door, is a reference to Pope Nicholas's decision to declare 1450 a Jubilee Year.On the right, St Lawrence is shown framed in the entrance to a colonnaded basilica of great monumentality. The distant apse further frames and gives emphasis to the saint. He is attended by the poor, blind and lame, and hands money to a legless man in the immediate foreground. His scarlet vestment is scattered with golden flames and hints at his future death by burning.
./images/846.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Fresco	In 1447, or perhaps earlier, Fra Angelico was in Rome, where he painted the private chapel of Pope Nicholas V with scenes from the lives of St Lawrence and St Stephen, frescoes which sum up the whole trend of his work. They possess a logical realism in their perspective settings, clarity of scale and narrative content, and restraint in their vigour. The colour is limpid, but with sufficient use of chiaroscuro to give substance to the figures; the use of continuous  representation is kept to a minimum by the division of the scenes through differences in their architectural setting, but nowhere is the search for realism in the use of lighting effects allowed to destroy the unity of the whole, or the sense of the plane of the wall.The stories are told with a wealth of circumstantial  and colourful detail: for instance the allusion to the Pope's decision to declare 1450 a Jubilee Year is shown by the two soldiers about to break down  the walled-up door on the left but even a detail of this kind is never intrusive or merely included for decorative richness, but is at the heart of the narrative.

./images/848.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Fresco	
./images/849.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Fresco	Fra Angelico's delicate vision appears to have been a bit overwhelmed by the vastness and imposing scale of Rome and its monuments. In order to become more consistent with the most modern style that was then the vogue in Rome, Fra Angelico attempted to imbue his scenes with Roman monumental classicism.This fresco was erraneously attributed to Benozzo Gozzoli. However, it is a work by Fra Angelico with coworkers.
./images/850.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Fresco	
./images/851.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Fresco	"Fra Angelico was entrusted with a number of commissions for the Vatican Palace. The one that involved the most work was the decoration of the small room in the ancient tower of Pope Innocent III that Nicholas V turned into his private chapel, a rectangular space with a groin vault. The floor installed at this time survives. It displays the emblem of Nicholas V, a radiant sun. The frescoes show scenes from the lives of Sts Stephen and Lawrence, in two horizontal bands. On the rear wall was a Deposition, also by Fra Angelico and mentioned by Vasari, but now lost. On the arches are the eight Doctors of the Church in Gothic aedicules. The Evangelists are on the vault, while on the window jambs rosettes with the head of Christ alternate with heads of patriarchs and prophets.The cycle is generally attributed to Fra Angelico and his workshop. The hand of Benozzo Gozzoli has been identified in some of the scenes from the life of St Stephen. Painted for the jubilee of 1450, the cycle clearly reveals the program pursued by Nicholas V of a link between Christian and classical culture. Fra Angelico's figures have a ""Roman"" appearance: they stand solemn and serious, like heroes from antiquity, against a background of theatrical architecture, reminding the beholder of the buildings of ancient Rome. The intention was to underline the continuity between imperial and Christian Rome which the pope wished to assert."
./images/852.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Fresco	The fresco cycle consists of scenes from the lives of the archdeacons Stephen (lunette) and Lawrence (bottom register).On the east wall the narratives run parallel. To the left in the lunette St Stephen is being led to his martyrdom, and to the right we see him being stoned to death. In the lower register Lawrence is first condemned by Emperor Valerian, then in the adjacent scene he is martyred by being roasted on a gridiron. Between these is an auxiliary motif, seen through a small window, showing the conversion of St Hyppolitus, the chief jailer.
./images/853.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Fresco	The lunette represents two scenes: St Stephen being led to His Martyrdom; Stoning of St Stephen.Stephen had been blessed by the Apostles and was the first to be ordained as deacon. Accused of blasphemy, he was stoned to death in Jerusalem. According to legend his remains were taken to Rome in the fifth century and buried beside those of St Lawrence.This lunette is divided in two by the monumental city wall which forms a natural part of both the scenes portrayed. The soft hills strewn with collections of towers and houses are in Angelico's familiar landscape style. All lit from the same source, the lunette has a complete spatial unity.On the left St Stephen, having incurred the wrath of the council, is dragged to the city gate and meets his fate outside it as the first Christian martyr. On the right he is portrayed at prayer. Around him are the stones which have bloodied his face; two more bounce off the back of his head; one of his executioners raises another one high, about to strike again, and holds more in his robe. Saul, who was a consenting witness to the execution, is shown, following the details given in the Acts of the Apostles, as a young man holding part of Stephen's clothes which had been laid at his feet by the witnesses.
./images/854.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Fresco	This scene is the left half the lunette on the east wall.
./images/855.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Fresco	This scene is the right half the lunette on the east wall. The left half depicts St Stephen being led to his martyrdom.In this scene he is portrayed at prayer following the description that 'he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge.' (Apostles 8, v. 60). Around him are the stones which have bloodied his face; two more bounce off the back of his head; one of his executioners raises another one high, about to strike again, and holds more in his robe. Saul, who was a consenting witness to the execution, is shown, following the details given in the Acts of the Apostles, as a young man holding part of Stephen's clothes which had been laid at his feet by the witnesses.
./images/856.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Fresco	
./images/857.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Fresco	This scene is the left half the fresco below the lunette on the east wall. The right half depicts the martyrdom of St Lawrence. The two are linked by the cornice which, although it changes in its detailing, is essentially common to both scenes.The composition of Condemnation of St Lawrence by the Emperor Valerian owes much to Angelico's earlier sacra conversazione. The wall broken into sections by pilasters, hung with a rich ornamental curtain and incorporating a lofty architectural throne, is familiar from the Annalena altarpiece of a couple of years before. Various soldiers and city worthies stand in a circle before the Emperor, helping to create a sense of depth without the assistance of any converging orthogonals in the foreground.

./images/860.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Fresco	Following convention, the four evangelists appear in the ceiling's cross-ribbed vaulting against a starry sky. Drawings survive for the St Mark and St Matthew (Musée Condé, Chantilly, Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge), considered to be works by Benozzo Gozzoli.
./images/861.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Fresco	In the vaults of the chapel, the Evangelists are suspended on clouds, amid the starry blue heavens. Their luminous faces and pale garments seem suffused with incandescent light as they compose the Gospels of Christ's life.

./images/868.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera on panel	This panel is part of a series, now consisting of thirty-five panels, commissioned by Piero de Medici for the doors of a cupboard at the San Marco convent, and depicting scenes from the life of Christ.In this, the first panel, the prophet Ezekiel and St Gregory the Great sit in a mountainous landscape with the river Chobar running between them. In the top left of the panel is a text from the first book of Ezekiel outlining the prophet's vision, which is shown below. Ezekiel leans back, his hands raised in surprise. His vision included four animalia who, 'had one likeness: and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel', (Ezekiel 1, v. 16). It is this wheel within a wheel which is shown here with a flaming circumference. Angelico depicts the wheel as being made of two concentric circles. Around the larger wheel is the account of the creation from Genesis, and around the smaller the first three verses of the Gospel of St. John, 'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the word was God ...', which echo the words from Genesis.At the top right of the picture is an excerpt from the writings of St Gregory, who interpreted the prophet's vision and used it to emphasize parallels between the Old and New Testaments. The theme of parallels between the two Testaments is pursued through all the other panels in the series.
./images/869.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera on wood	Although the themes and settings of the scenes are varied, Angelico united the ensemble with consistently scaled figures, architecture and horizons. The Annunciation takes place within a deep, open courtyard framed by twin porticos, inspired by the architecture of the church.Throughout the cycle, parallel and prophetic texts amplify the resonance of every scene. In the Annunciation, the quotations from the Book of Isaiah and the Gospel of Luke are virtually identical in phrasing, confirming, according to Christian exegesis, that Isaiah's prophecy was fulfilled through the Incarnation and divinely ordered.
./images/870.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera on wood	This scene shows the continuing influence on Angelico of naturalism. Having been warned in a dream, Joseph, Mary and the infant Christ make their escape from Herod's massacres by going into Egypt. Behind them a series of trees of diminishing size plots out the perspective of the landscape. The Holy Family is lit by a strong light from the left, the Virgin's draperies carefully delineated so as to show the position of both her legs as she rides side-saddle on the donkey. As in The Circumcision her halo is depicted as a three-dimensional object, which can both turn in space and reflect light. It was only late in his career as a painter that Angelico began to develop the spatial properties of the nimbus.
./images/871.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera on wood	Herod, with crown and sceptre, watches from above the infanticide he has ordained. The sinister, dark-clad soldiers pour through the archway wielding black daggers against the children. The mothers, shown in a great variety of terrified postures and with looks of horror, attempt to protect their infants, but to no avail.
./images/872.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera on wood	
./images/873.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera on wood	In the Temple, Christ is presented for circumcision. The table takes centre stage and its receding top leads the eye back to the choir. The forms of the three figures in the foreground are echoed in the background by the three arched walls of the choir and their windows. The chiefly vertical fall of the draperies of all the figures is painted with great discrimination, and echoes the fluting of the pilasters.
./images/874.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera and gold on panel	The superimposed scenes are portrayed on a golden ground, the elaborately tooled patterns and rich array of colours of which seem inspired by the exquisite textiles and chromatic brilliance ofGentile da Fabriano's altarpiece.
./images/875.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera and gold on panel	The Madonna of the Star portrays the Virgin holding the Child on an incised, golden radiance as she embraces him tenderly. The image of the standing Virgin and Child emerged from a rich biblical and visual tradition exemplified in amarble statue by Nino Pisanoin the Santa Maria Novella.
./images/876.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera and gold on panel	In this early altarpiece by Fra Angelico the Virgin and Child are in the centre, while Sts Dominic and John the Baptist are represented on the left and Sts Peter Martyr and Thomas Aquinas on the right. On the upper part scenes from the life of St Peter Martyr are depicted.

./images/881.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera and gold on panel	The altarpiece Madonna and Child with Saints Jerome, John the Baptist, Francis and Onophrius is known as the Compagnia di San Francesco Altarpiece.Fra Angelico's renown extended beyond the congregations of his Order. In accord with the mission of Saint Dominic to evangelize, the friar expressed the lessons of his faith for numerous clients. Documents demonstrate that a range of patrons sought his work throughout the 1420s. In 1429, the penitential confraternity of San Francesco, which met in the cloister of Santa Croce, paid Fra Angelico ('frate Guido') for its altarpiece. Though the altarpiece was cut apart at some point in its history, its components have been identified. The central and lateral panels are in the Museo di San Marco, Florence, while the predella panels are dispersed in various collections.

./images/888.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera on panel	This altarpiece, exhibited now in the Musée du Louvre together with its seven predella pictures, was executed for the church San Domenico in Fiesole, and it is one of the most famous of Fra Angelico's works. It is a good example of the painter's art of tempera painting with fresh colours that have not changed. On the predella the story of San Domenico is depicted.In this altarpiece Fra Angelico departs markedly from his usual methods of space projection, but this can be explained by the extreme difficulty of integrating so complex a composition as a traditional Coronation, into the type of space he had recently employed. The whole, although still a heavenly scene, is set on terra firma. The sky is a realistic blue and not gold. The very low view-point enables the assembled saints and angels to be placed in a series of tiers without obscuring one another. The figures in the foreground kneel so as not to attract undue emphasis. Mary Magdalen holds out her jar of oil, marking the central axis.Recently a date of 1450, which is considered compatible with the internal dating evidence of this altarpiece, is suggested.
./images/889.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera on panel	St Nicholas of Bari is shown kneeling in the foreground of The Coronation of the Virgin with his episcopal mitre and crook. St Nicholas's cope shows several scenes from the Passion, including the Betrayal, Mocking, and Flagellation. To his left are St Anthony and St Francis of Assisi.
./images/890.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera on panel	St Catherine of Alexandria stands holding her wheel and regarding St Agnes, who clutches her own symbol, a lamb. St Agnes's robe falls in heavy sculptured loops to the ground. The haloes of the two saints are carefully arranged so that St Catherine's face is not obscured. The haloes in this painting are treated very flatly but in some cases also extremely decoratively, being studded with gems.
./images/891.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera on wood	Fra Angelico dedicated several of his works to the scene of Mary's coronation (Louvre, Paris; Museo di San Marco, Florence, Uffizi, Florence). In these pictures the ceremoniousness of the event is lessened by the gentle charm of the details.This painting is from the church of Sant'Egidio of Ospedale di Santa Maria Nuova in Florence. Its approach is special in that it presents the scene in the sky, floating on clouds, thus placing Jesus and Mary and their surrounding entourage in an interesting perspective. Spatial relations are illustrated by the use of size differences, the virtuoso rendering of light-rays, and colour perspective.The angelic choir greets the Queen of Heavens with song and dance. In the right foreground, with his back to the viewer, an angel dressed in blue plays the portative organ; his companion to the left a stringed instrument. Above, on both sides of the main group, the trumpets are raised high above the heads. Among the other instruments we can recognize a beautiful lute on the left, and a small oval-shaped violin (or mandola) on the right. The inner ring is composed of six tall, dancing angels; their flowing robes and the position of their hands indicate the direction of their movement.

./images/893.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera and gold on panel	The picture shows one of the predella panels of the Coronation of the Virgin.The Coronation of the Virgin was painted by Fra Angelico for the church of the hospital of Santa Maria Nuova. Although the original frame of the altarpiece is lost, the two panels that formed its predella have been identified. They represent the Marriage of the Virgin, which theologians regarded as a prefiguration of the Coronation, and the Dormition of the Virgin, which immediately precedes the Coronation. Each scene displays Angelico's command of perspective, nuanced portrayal of emotion and radiant colour.

./images/895.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Panel	The attribution and the datation of this painting was long debated. However, after a successful restoration it is today appreciated as one of the painter's masterpieces. The artist returned time after time to his favourite theme of the angel bringing the news and the devout Mary in a posture of humble acceptance.The size of the main panel is 149 x 158 cm, while the five predella panels, representing five scenes of the life of the Virgin (the Marriage of the Virgin, the Visitation, the Adoration of the Magi, the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple, and the Funeral of the Virgin), have the size of 17 x 26 cm each.
./images/896.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera and gold on panel	The painting got the name from its original location, the Convento di San Vincenzo d'Annalena, founded by Annalena Malatesta.This is Angelico's second sacra conversazione, and shares many elements in common with its forerunner, the San Marco altarpiece. Unlike the San Marco altarpiece, however, there are no angels here and the Virgin and Child are in the company only of Sts Peter Martyr, Cosmas, Damian, John the Evangelist, Lawrence and Francis. Although they have left their individual panels, never to return, there is still an echo of these in the blank arches of the wall which closes the back of the picture.The high wall and its pink cornice run the full width of the panel. The natural world, which was the setting of the first altarpiece, is now confined to the grass and flowers at the very front of the picture. There is no carpet on the ground here and the foreground is much shallower than in the earlier work. The method of space projection remains basically the same and relies on the receding rectangles of the steps to the throne and of its cornice. An element common to both altarpieces is the use of a carpet running across the back of the picture parallel to the picture plane.
./images/897.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera and gold on panel	Although the original location of this altarpiece is the Convento di San Vincenzo d'Annalena, it seems to have been painted for the double chapel of the Medici family, dedicated to Sts Cosmas and Damian and located on the south transept of San Lorenzo, Florence. In the mid-1430s, San Lorenzo was still under construction. The represented saints on the altarpiece are the patron saints of the male members of the Medici dynasty, and the predella (executed by Zanobi Strozzi) contains scenes from the life of Sts Cosmas and Damian.
./images/898.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera and gold on panel	In the rhythmic treatment of the architectural elements, Fra Angelico inserts figures that will later serve as the starting point for his most gifted pupil, Benozzo Gozzoli.
./images/899.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera and gold on panel	This altarpiece was painted by Angelico after his return from Rome for the Franciscan convent of Bosco ai Frati in Mugello. It was probably commissioned by Cosimo de' Medici who started the renovation of the convent in 1438. The altarpiece represents the Virgin and Child enthroned with two angels, and Sts Anthony of Padua, Louis of Toulouse and Francis (on the left), as well as Sts Cosmas, Damian and Peter Martyr (on the right).The altarpiece shows further developments of the formula that underlies his earlier sacra conversazione. The architecture is richer and more plastic, so that its articulation of the picture space is partly camouflaged. The throne has been widened and heightened, now looking like the apse of a small church, bringing greater emphasis to the Virgin and Child at the expense of the saints. The wall is enlivened by a series of recessions and projections in the form of niches and half ionic columns. Although the grass and flowers have been excluded from the foreground, the natural world reasserts itself, albeit in a symmetrical composition, behind the wall.
./images/900.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera and gold on panel	This altarpiece was painted by Angelico after his return from Rome for the Franciscan convent of Bosco ai Frati in Mugello. It was probably commissioned by Cosimo de' Medici who started the renovation of the convent in 1438.

./images/902.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Poplar	Fra Angelico's late Last Judgment is close to Trecento sources, to the school of Orcagna in particular. It was painted when the popular artist had a large studio. Perhaps the painting is by Zanubi Strozzi, who was predominantly a manuscript illuminator. Originally on a single panel, the scene was cut into thirds at a much later date.
./images/903.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera and gold on panel	The austerity of this painting seems a reinterpretation of Gentile da Fabriano'smagnificent altarpiecethat focuses on the solemnity of Epiphany rather than the splendour of the Magi's entourage or the richness of their garments.
./images/904.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera and gold on panel	The slender anatomy of Christ, the taut contours shadowed against the gold ground and the windblown loincloth are related closely to the Crucifixions by Lorenzo Monaco and his workshop, as is the foreshortening of his head, lowered in death. While derived from Lorenzo's portrayals, Angelico's interpretation is stylistically different, best expressed in the figures of the mourners below the Cross. The artist created the illusion of depth by varying the angles at which they are portrayed and through perspective.
./images/905.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera and gold on panel	Fra Angelico's earliest paintings are generally dated in the early 1420s. However, it seems likely that several were executed before the 1420s, for they interpret themes associated with Lorenzo Monaco in a style and sensibility closely related to that of the master. They may be attributed to Angelico because of their analogies to paintings from the 1420s known to be by him. A crucial painting for understanding this early period is the Madonna of Humility in St. Petersburg.The theme of the Madonna of Humility originated  in the mid-fourteenth century and surged in popularity through the first few decades of the fifteenth century. It was portrayed time and again by Lorenzo Monaco and his workshop. It shows the Virgin, humbly seated on the ground instead of majestically enthroned, tenderly holding the infant Jesus on her lap. The attribution of this Madonna to Angelico is substantiated by a comparison with thecentral panelof the San Domenico di Fiesole Altarpiece.
./images/906.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera and gold on panel	This painting formed the central panel of a dismembered altarpiece and is enclosed in its original frame. It was commissioned by the illustrious Florentine Giugni family. The patronage by so prominent a family indicates the professional stature the painter had achieved at this time. The panel was inspired by the paintings of this theme by Lorenzo Monaco and his workshop.
./images/907.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Poplar	This humble image by Fra Angelico approaches the new lyricism of Ghiberti, Quercia, and Masolino. Though Fra Angelico has adopted the fourteenth-century devotional formula for his Madonna, with Mary seated close to the ground, he cannot help investing her with a richly tasseled pillow and a lavishly brocaded cloth of honour. Sts Dominic and Peter Martyr are tucked in at the left and right.
./images/908.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera and gold on panel	This panel, probably the centre part of a triptych or a wing of a diptych, was formerly attributed to Giovanni Toscani (d. 1430), a follower of Masaccio and Masolino. Recent reconsideration of the attribution gave the painting to the young Fra Angelico.
./images/909.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera and gold on panel	This panel was inspired by theMadonna and Child with Saint Anneby Masaccio and Masolino.
./images/910.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera and gold on panel	The family coat-of-arms of the donors, Agnolo di Zanobi Gaddi, descendant of the painters Agnolo and Taddeo Gaddi, and his wife, Maddalena Niccolò Ridolfi, are painted on the lower corners of the panel.
./images/911.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera and gold on panel	This panel was one of the four reliquaries that Fra Angelico made for the Dominican church of Santa Maria Novella, Florence. The other three are in the Museo di San Marco, Florence.This panel is divided into two sections: below, the Virgin Mary's obsequies are coming to an end, and above is her Assumption into heaven. In the lower register Christ has come to collect the Virgin Mary's soul, which he holds in the form of a small child.
./images/912.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera on panel	Here Angelico shows an increasing command of space and an equal interest in its depiction. He has added a carefully rendered, elegant throne raised over three steps, which fills the greater part of the panel and produces a bold spatial statement. Its top takes the form of a hexagonal cupola, but this still has chiefly pointed arches and cannot be said to represent the architectural avant-garde of the time. Compared with his later depictions of architecture it lacks monumentality. There is no attempt to extend the picture space into the far distance or to heighten the realism further, as the background of the panel is rendered in plain gold in the trecento fashion.
./images/913.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera and gold on panel	Two panels in Detroit represent the Annunciation at the moment when the angel Gabriel greets the Virgin. She responds in a gesture of humble acceptance, crossing her arms over her chest. In her right hand she holds a small red bound book. She has marked the place by her finger.The original provenance and function of these two panels is uncertain. Though they are clearly fragments, it has never been ascertained whether they had been  cut out of a larger composition, were the subsidiary part of an altarpiece, or constituted the wings of a diptych

./images/915.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera with gilding on wood	This small high quality panel shows the Virgin in glory between two groups of praying angels. She is worshipped by Saint Dominic and Saint Catherine of Alexandria, who appear on a smaller scale at the sides of the throne. The former, wearing the Dominican habit, holds a lily in one hand, and in the other the book of the Constitutions of the Order of Preachers (Dominicans); the latter, recognizable by her attribute, the wheel, holds the martyr's palm between her hands. The holy child, standing on his mother's lap, strokes her cheek with his right hand while she holds him close, and in her free hand she holds a white rose.The early provenance of the panel is not known.

The panels illustrate stories from the legends of the Virgin Mary, the apostle St James the Great, St John the Baptist, and Sts Francis and Dominic. The scenes are the following: The Apostle St James the Great Freeing the Magician Hermogenes; The Naming of St John the Baptist; The Burial of the Virgin and the Reception of Her Soul in heaven; The Meeting of Sts Dominic and Francis of Assisi. The fifth panel of the predella is lost. The altarpiece would have shown the Virgin and Child and the same saints whose scenes are depicted in the predella.The predella panels show the influence of Masaccio's frescoes in the Brancacci Chapel, specific derivations from them can be detected in most scenes.

./images/923.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera on panel	The painting is attributed by some scholars to the workshop of Fra Angelico. Stylistically it is close to the predella pictures of the Santa Trinita altarpiece.
./images/924.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera and gold on panel	The Lamentation was made for the Dominican confraternity's oratory, the façade of which was painted with scenes from the Passion of Christ. It portrayed the loving compassion of the Virgin, Mary Magdalene, and other saints as they mourned the death of Jesus and prepared him for the grave.The bottom of the painting is damaged.

./images/926.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera on panel	In this painting, the image of Mary recalls the ideal of beauty promoted in International Gothic art, although her pose and shape give her a three-dimensionality and solidity closer to the art of Masaccio. The Virgin is placed, following the traditional iconography of the Virgin of Humility, on a cushion rather than a throne.The painting is notable for its brilliant and luminous palette, in which reds, blues and golds are harmoniously combined. Also outstanding is the sweetness and spirituality of the faces of the figures, whose poses and gestures are depicted with great naturalism.
./images/927.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera on wood	In a landscape composed of sharp-edged rocks evoking the rough countryside surrounding the hermitage at Verna, Saint Francis kneels in ecstasy before Christ in the form of an angel. From the wounds of Christ on this cross spring rays that imprint the stigmata on Francis' hands, his feet, and his side. On the right, Brother Leone, seated with his shoulders against the chapel walls, is awakened by the blinding light of the apparition.It is assumed that this panel of unknown origin was part of a predella.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 33 minutes):Michael Haydn: St Francis Mass
./images/928.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Panel	Documents indicate the this tondo may have originally belonged to Lorenzo de' Medici, ruler of Florence and patron of Renaissance artists. Following the three kings a splendid procession, symbolizing all the races of mankind, waits to pay homage to the new-born Christ. The peacock is a symbol of Resurrection. Some scholars believe that Fra Angelico laid out the composition and painted the Virgin and Child and at least some of the figures at the upper right; then his associate and fellow monk Fra Filippo Lippi completed the work.
./images/929.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera on wood	This detail of thetondo by Angelico and Lippishows the Virgin, the only one of the main figures in the work considered to be by Angelico. Comparison between her head and those of the Magus kneeling before her and Joseph to her left, reveals that they are modelled in completely different fashions.
./images/930.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera and gold on panel	This painting was originally the central panel of a triptych. The arms of the cross stretch right across the panel, as if intended to strengthen its frame. The upper limb takes the form of a flourishing tree, a possible reference to the popular Legend of the True Cross which claimed that the wood used for the crucifixion came originally from the tree of Jesse. In the branches of the tree sits a pelican in its piety, plucking its breast so that blood flows to feed its young, a common symbol of Christ giving of himself for the redemption of the world.Cardinal Juan de Torquemada, a noted Dominican, kneels before the cross, his red cardinal's hat on the ground before him next to the rivulets of blood. On either side of the cross stand the Virgin and St John. The cross is in no landscape or other spatial setting. There is only an abstract gold ground behind. At the foot of the cross is a skull representing Golgotha. Its Spartan design and intense, but quietly expressed, feeling make this a powerful image reminiscent of some of Angelico's earlier frescoes in the convent of San Marco.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 22 minutes):Heinrich Schütz: Die sieben Worte am Kreuz SWV 478
./images/931.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Poplar	This panel was part of the predella of an altarpiece, probably painted for an altarpiece at Pontassieve. Other sections completing the predella depicting scenes from the life of St Francis are in Berlin (The Apparition at Arles), in the Vatican (Receiving the Stigmata), and in Altenburg (St Francis before the Sultan).

./images/934.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Fresco	The earliest of Fra Angelico's mural paintings is the Crucified Christ in the Chapter House of San Domenico, the room where the friars, sometimes joined by the laity, assembled for meetings. To enhance its poignant realism, the artist foreshortened Christ's lowered head and torso from the perspective of the kneeling worshipper. The slender, idealized body is anatomically detailed and luminously modelled. The inscriptions - in Hebrew, Greek and Latin - on the titulus of the cross identify Christ as 'Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews.'
./images/935.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Detached fresco	The fresco (repainted) was detached and transferred to masonite support.
./images/936.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Detached sinopia	This sinopia was discovered beneath a fresco (poorly repainted in the 19th century) above the doorway of the new Novitiate of the monastery in Fiesole. During the restoration in 1960 the original surface reappeared and the sinopia was removed for conservation. It reveals the unmistakable style of Fra Angelico.
./images/937.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Detached fresco transferred to canvas	This fresco comes from the monastery of San Domenico da Fiesole, where Fra Angelico, a Dominican monk, was prior. After the monastery was closed in the 19th century this fresco was removed and sold. Originally the fresco was located at the top of the stairs leading to the dormitory.Without pursuing the dynamic action and spatial depth sought by most of his contemporaries, Fra Angelico achieves a sculpture-like monumentality that links this artist with the refined intellectual Piero della Francesca.

./images/940.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera and gold on parchment	Some eighteen pages of the San Marco Missal 558, kept in the Museo di San Marco in Florence, bear illuminations by Angelico's hand and a further eleven those by other members of his workshop. This picture shows a page (folio 67 verso) from the Missal. It depicts the Glorification of St Dominic.St Dominic, the founder of the Order of Preachers, stands within a golden mandorla (oval panel) in the habit of a Dominican, eight angels surrounding him, the four uppermost glorifying him in music. Below the mandorla to the right are the saint's iconographic emblems: the star and the dog with a torch in its mouth, here shown as a jet of flame. The solid modelling of St Dominic is repeated in the sculptural qualities of the four saints who appear in the roundels sprouting out of the initial I. In the fifth roundel St Dominic is shown greeting his contemporary, St Francis of Assisi.
./images/941.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera and gold on parchment	The picture shows a detail of a page (folio 21) of Missal 558. It depicts the Conversion of St Paul.A light from heaven appears to Paul and the voice of Christ asks why He is persecuted by him. Paul is shown here lying on the ground, in a rather unrealistically relaxed pose, with Damascus, his destination, in the background represented as a town wall of simple geometric forms rendered in ambiguous perspective. A cross-shaped halo identifies the foreshortened figure in the mandorla as Christ.
./images/942.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera and gold on parchment	The book of hymns for the Mass, that contains the sung portions of the Mass and the liturgy for the feast days of several saints, known as Messale 558, comprises 261 folios, thirty-six of which are embellished with large, decorated divinities in elaborate frames surrounded by brilliantly coloured vine scrolls. Many of them are by Fra Angelico, although another artist assisted him, confirming his establishment of a workshop in San Domenico in these early years.The Madonna of Mercy is from Messale 558.
./images/943.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera and gold on parchment	This miniature is from the San Marco Missal 558, fol. 33v.
./images/944.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera and gold on parchment	Some eighteen pages of the San Marco Missal 558, kept in the Museo di San Marco in Florence, bear illuminations by Angelico's hand and a further eleven those by other members of his workshop. This picture shows an initial P from folio 41v enclosing a scene with the Assassination of Saint Peter Martyr. The initial begins the introit to the Mass for the feast of St Peter Martyr.Although Angelico's early training was undoubtedly with Lorenzo Monaco at Santa Maria degli Angeli and may have included a period in that convent's scriptorium, he is never called a miniatore (illuminator). The two fields were always distinguished from each other in writings of the time, and therefore Angelico probably only occasionally painted illuminations. The San Marco Missal 558 contains most miniatures that are likely to be by Angelico's hand. About eighteen folios can be considered for the most part autograph, the rest, although very close in conception, are not by his hand, more than one artist (including Zanobi Strozzi) may have illuminated them.
./images/945.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Tempera and gold on parchment	The programme of decoration for the convent of San Marco, Florence, included the production of illuminated books for the celebration of Mass. This illuminated initial depicting King David is from a Psalter painted c. 1443-45 and bound in 1449.
./images/946.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Fresco	In the summer of 1447 Fra Angelico, assisted by Benozzo Gozzoli and several other minor artists, had painted a fresco of the Prophets in one of the triangular ceiling vaults and Christ the Judge in another in the Chapel of San Brizio, a large Gothic construction built around 1408 in the Orvieto Cathedral. The remaining sections of the ceiling werepainted by Luca Signorelliin 1499-1502.In the centre of the quadrant above the altar, Christ proffers the globe of the universe as he raises his right hand to summon the dead from their graves. Seated upon banks of clouds against a golden background, he radiates a gilded aureole of light, the scintillating rays of which illuminate the faces and garments of the seraphim surrounding him.

The remaining sections of the ceiling werepainted by Luca Signorelliin 1499-1502.In the quadrant adjacent to that show wing Christ the Judge, Angelico portrayed Old Testament prophets whose writings, it was believed, foretold the coming of Christ. Like Christ, they are painted against a golden ground and suspended on clouds, their garments radiant with the reflected light of his glory. Angelico varied their ages, appearance and attributes, conveying the personality of each man, from the introspective King David, fingering his harp as he composes his psalms, to Moses, his face and azure mantle glowing with the light of God. The tablets held by Moses are inscribed with the first of the Ten Commandments in Hebrew.

./images/950.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Pen and brown ink and purple wash on vellum	In the reformed Dominican communities such as Angelico's own, San Marco, it is known that manuscript illumination was encouraged and prac tised. There is only one volume in which extensive work can safely be attributed to him, and that is the Missal number 558 at San Marco. This drawing of King David playing a Psaltery appears to be closely related in style to the work in Missal 558. David sits awkwardly, at the base of a throne on a seat, plucking at the strings of his psaltery. The depiction of the plinth, panelling, entablature and other details of the architecture on which he rests, suggests that this drawing dates from the same period as the San Marco Missal, but there can be no certainty that it was actually intended as a sketch or preparatory drawing for a manuscript illumination. The solidity and depth of parts of the draperies hint at the modelling of which Angelico was capable.
./images/951.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Pen and wash on pink tinted paper	This drawing may be associated with one of the lost scenes from the second floor of the Vatican Palace. They were destroyed by Pope Paul III to build the Pauline Chapel (painted by Michelangelo in 1542-50). The drawing, made on pint tinted paper, was executed in pen and wash with intense bistre (white) highlights on the drapery of the figures.
./images/952.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Metalpoint on prepared ochre surface	This study of exceptional quality is either a drawing by Fra Angelico which should be considered as a model given by the master to his pupils, or it is the work of the most famous of Angelico's pupils at the time, Benozzo Gozzoli. The verso of the drawing depicts a group of figures directly related to the frescoes for the chapel of Pope Nicholas V, completed in the Vatican palace by Fra Angelico and his workshop about 1448. The verso can be ascribed to the studio of Fra Angelico.

./images/957.jpg	ANGELUCCIO	Oil on canvas	"A 1692 Chigi inventory lists two paintings, the Rural Scene and the Figures in a Tree-lined Avenue (see at Cerquozzi) and indicates that they are the product of a collaboration between Angeluccio, who painted the landscape, and Michelangelo Cerquozzi, who painted the figures.These pictures and the documentary reference to them are an important basis for the reconstruction of the career of Giovanni Angelo, known by his nickname ""Angeluccio"".The biographer Pascoli mentions Angeluccio as a student of Claude Gellée (also known as Claude Lorrain), saying that among Claude's disciples there was ""of renown only Angeluccio, who died young and was only able to work a little"". Perhaps of Flemish origin (he is cited as a Fleming in an eighteenth century inventory of the Valenti Gonzaga collection), he shows the influence of the Flemish landscape technique, with particular closeness to the work of Bril. His typical compositional characteristics are the rendering of a spatial depth, the showing of the horizon through an aperture in the dense foliage of the large trees, the domination of landscape over the relatively tiny figures, and the intense play of light and shadow.Working in Rome probably between 1640 and 1650, Angeluccio was influenced by Swanevelt and Jan Both, and was an active member of the ""Bamboccianti"".Though Miel and van Bloemen also painted figures for Angeluccio's landscapes, the majority of his collaborations were with Michelangelo Cerquozzi. Angeluccio seems to have furnished background landscapes for his fellow ""Bamboccianti"" much as Viviano Codazzi executed architectural backgrounds for them. A hypothesis has even been advanced that the nickname ""Angeluccio"" is derived from the closeness of this artist to ""Michele Angelo"" Cerquozzi. The fruits of this collaboration entered into numerous important Roman collections in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the inventories of which either report the pictures as ""by Angeluccio with figures by Cerquozzi"", or as landscapes by Angeluccio alone."

./images/962.jpg	ANGUIER, FranÃ§ois	Marble	This tomb reveals the new Roman influence which the Anguiers introduced into France. The model for the monument as a whole is to be sought early in the century in Giacomo della Porta's Aldobrandini tombs in S. Maria sopra Minerva, although Anguier has enriched the design by sculptured decoration. The style of the figure sculpture is a variation of that which the artists would have learnt in the studio of Algardi in the 1640s, that is to say, a form of Baroque less extreme than Bernini's, and therefore more easily acceptable than his to a French public. The reclining figure of the Duke shows clearly the combination of influences present here. The pose is one traditional in France since the early seventeenth century, but the twist on the body, the undercut curls of the hair, and the lively treatment of the drapery all betray a Roman origin. In the figure of the Duchess classical influence is more visible, and this is even more clearly the case with the allegorical statues at the side of the main group which were executed by pupils. Michel Anguier's share seems to be limited to the seated Hercules below on the left, antique in conception but with some Baroque movement in the pose of torso and head.
./images/963.jpg	ANGUIER, Michel	Marble	Michel Anguier was the brother of the sculptor François Anguier and worked with Simon Guillain. He spent the years 1641 to 1651 in Italy, whence he returned with some ancient models. The marble Amphitrite was executed in 1680 in an anachronistic style more closely related to the spirit of the beginning of the century than to the spirit of Anguier's own time. It once decorated the Bosquet des Dômes at Versailles, was moved to the gardens of Saint-Cloud, and then came to the Louvre.

./images/968.jpg	ANGUIER, Michel	Marble and stucco	The Val-de-Grâce, designed by François Mansart and others, was begun in 1645 by Anne of Austria in fulfilment of a vow made before the birth of the Dauphin, later Louis XIV. The decoration of the interior was carried out by Michel Anguier between 1662 and 1667. Anguier's works at the Val-de-Grâce show the last form which the struggle of Baroque and classical tendencies took in him. The reliefs in the spandrels and on the vault of the nave are as classical as any work of the time, but in the group of the Nativity for the high altar, now in St Roch, Baroque movement asserts itself.
./images/969.jpg	ANGUISSOLA, Lucia	Oil on panel	This is the only known self-portrait by Lucia Anguissola, younger sister of Sofonisba. She portrays herself sitting down in an elegant but modest attire. She wears dark clothing under which appears a white blouse. In her left hand she holds a small book open on her lap, while her right hand rests on her chest, She is a young and virtuous woman lifting her gaze towards the viewer.It seems from this painting that Lucia was not less talented then her sister, Sofonisba.
./images/970.jpg	ANGUISSOLA, Lucia	Oil on panel	This painting was formerly attributed to Sofonisba Anguissola. The Anguissola sisters turned to each other for inspiration and for their subjects: both Sofonisba and Lucia used their sisters as models for paintings and drawings.
./images/971.jpg	ANGUISSOLA, Sofonisba	Oil on canvas	One of the period's most inventive portraitists came from Cremona. The noblewoman Sofonisba Anguissola created wry and witty portraits of family members and acquaintances, a subject largely imposed upon her by societal restrictions on female access to models and patrons. Sofonisba's painting of her teacher, painting her portrait - a story within a story - demonstrates how she negotiated her male-dominated world. Anguissola's gaze rivets the viewer of the painting, forcing consideration of what appears to be the inscribing of male authority on the body of the female. Campi's gaze complicates matters, however, since as he paints he, too, looks out of the painting toward what the picture indicates must be his subject, Anguissola. Thus the viewer in front of the painting plays a double role: that of the subject of the painting within the painting, namely Anguissola herself, and of an engaged viewer - watched by both Campi and Anguissola - made complicit in Anguissola's destabilizing of contemporary social norms.
./images/972.jpg	ANGUISSOLA, Sofonisba	Oil on canvas	That women could be intellectually accomplished and highly rational, even strategic, are the complementary themes of a family portrait showing Anguissola's three sisters playing chess. In this painting, which Vasari saw hanging in the artist's family home in Cremona in 1566, the chivalric game of chess takes place in an idealized landscape familiar in late medieval courtly images of the game and not in a tavern or other questionable locale seen in other contemporary representations of gaming. On the far left Lucia looks out at the viewer, dominating our gaze as her arm and obvious expertise dominate the chess board. She has removed two of Minerva's pieces from the game and the younger sister opens her mouth and raises her hand as if to speak. Their youngest companion, Europa, smiles gleefully at the match, carefully observed by an old maid servant at the far right.The three Anguissola women are members of a natural nobility capable of entertaining themselves, their status emphasized by the rich surface detail on their brocaded clothes and the fine Turkish carpet set over their table.
./images/973.jpg	ANGUISSOLA, Sofonisba	Black chalk and charcoal on brown paper	Obviously self-aware and politely subversive, Anguissola Sofonisba seems to have been willing to challenge Michelangelo in both craft and wit. Her father had arranged to for the most famous artist of the age to shown one of his daughter's drawings of a laughing child. - an obvious ploy to certify her talent for undertaking a task that Leonardo had described in his notebooks as requiring rare talent and nuance in order that the figure not appear pained or angered instead. Michelangelo begrudgingly admitted its proficiency and perversely claimed that showing a crying child would be even more difficult. Anguissola responded with a presentation drawing (shown in the picture, now heavily damaged). The scene seems a logical enough response to Michelangelo's remark: one of Anguissola's younger sisters calms their only brother Asdrubale who is being bitten by a crawfish.
./images/974.jpg	ANGUISSOLA, Sofonisba	Black chalk heightened with white	Sofonisba Anguissola was among the first artists to produce composition drawings of genre subjects, an unusual category in sixteenth-century Italian draftsmanship. This sheet is a celebrated surviving example of that activity. The highly finished, meticulous technique indicates that it was created as presentation drawing rather than as preparatory study for painting.
./images/975.jpg	ANGUISSOLA, Sofonisba	Oil on canvas	It is assumed by some critics that the painting represents the artist herself, not her sister Minerva.
./images/976.jpg	ANGUISSOLA, Sofonisba	Oil on canvas	In the painting the nun wears a lily-white habit which stands out against the dark background. The red and gold bound book of prayers offers the only source of detail. The sitter is usually identified as Elena Anguissola, Sofonisba's younger sister who had been a student of the painter Bernardino Campi along with Sofonisba, and later entered the monastery of San Vincenzo in Mantua assuming the name of Sister Minerva.
./images/977.jpg	ANGUISSOLA, Sofonisba	Oil on canvas	Formerly the painting was attributed to Titian, then to Bronzino. The minuteness in the representation of the reobe is noteworthy.
./images/978.jpg	ANGUISSOLA, Sofonisba	Oil on canvas	Both the authorship of the portrait and the identity of the sitter are debated. The painting perhaps was executed by Sofonisba's sister, Lucia, and the sitter could be Minerva, another daughter of Amilcare Anguissola.
./images/979.jpg	ANGUISSOLA, Sofonisba	Oil on parchment	It is assumed that this miniature was intended to be a gift to the miniaturist Giulio Clovio.
./images/980.jpg	ANGUISSOLA, Sofonisba	Oil on canvas	The artist depicts herself in a simple brownish-red habit, covered by a smooth black waistcoat. Under the dress, she wears a white blouse, closed around the neck, with a high collar and cuffs decorated with folded hems. She is painting a Madonna and Child, shown in a particularly affectionate pose.The depiction of the artist at an easel has a precedentin a self-portraitby the Flemish artist, Catharina van Hemessen, dated 1548, but it is not certain, that Sofonisba was aware  of the existence of this painting.
./images/981.jpg	ANGUISSOLA, Sofonisba	Oil on panel	"In this youthful self-portrait, the painter has shown herself dressed simply, with the hem of the ruffled blouse peeping out from under the smooth black waistcoat and brownish cuff. On the small open book she holds in her hand can plainly be read ""Sophonisba Angussola Virgo Seipsam fecit 1554."""

./images/986.jpg	ANSALDO, Giovanni Andrea	Oil on canvas	The painting is an allegory of the crowning of the young Grand Duke Ferdinando II. His father died in 1621 while the prince was still a child, and he became Grand Duke on coming of age in 1629. His mother Maria Maddalena of Austria and his grandmother, Cristina of Lorraine acted as regents during this lengthy period.
./images/987.jpg	ANSALDO, Giovanni Andrea	Oil on canvas 170 x 127 cm	"The unusual iconography, with the Madonna dressed in the habit of a gypsy, makes it interesting to trace the different interpretations of the painting. The concept of Ansaldo's work may derive directly from a work by Luca Cambiaso that Ratti saw during the eighteenth century at the Palazzo Barberini. In his notes on Soprani's biographies of the Genovese Painters, Ratti described how ""in Rome at the Palazzo Barberini, there is a painting of the Virgin dressed in the manner of the gypsies, who flees to Egypt with the infant Christ in her arms"".To support this hypothesis it is necessary to refer to two known Cambiaso paintings of the head of the Madonna with an identical attire, datable to around 1570, which may be smaller-format versions of the lost Palazzo Barberini picture. Even more closely related is a drawing of the Madonna of the Promenade showing the Virgin taking a stroll, wearing the same attire and large hat, and with the child held in a sling over her shoulder. Also similar iconographically and in other ways is a canvas of Bernardo Strozzi (Genoa; private collection). In the context of this connection, it is helpful to recall that Strozzi was in close contact with Ansaldo during the very years to which the painting has been dated.The painting is dated to 1620-30, since its appearance can be connected to other works from Ansaldo's period of full maturity. The numerous stylistic sources that lie at the base of Ansaldo's mature style may be discerned in this work. Cross-breeding with each other and the aforementioned Cambiasesque currents, one recognizes the influence of Barocci (as seen through his Sienese followers Banni and Salimbeni), the well assimilated influence of Rubens, as well as that of Gentileschi, who was working in Genoa during the time that Ansaldo painted this picture."

./images/989.jpg	ANTELAMI, Benedetto	Stone	Between the end of the Roman Empire and the early 11th century there was virtually no figure sculpture in Europe. The art had to be re-invented. It began tentatively in the form of small low reliefs, developing slowly into life-size sculpture in the round. Benedetto Antelami is the representative of the late 12th-century sculpture.

./images/991.jpg	ANTELAMI, Benedetto	Stone	September is illustrated by the grape harvest.
./images/992.jpg	ANTELAMI, Benedetto	Stone	Romanesque sculpture was at the height of its vitality during the last third of the twelfth and even at the beginning of the thirteenth century. The quest for new paths began about 1180 by the appearance of strong personalities. Among them, Benedetto Antelami is perhaps the sculptor whose fame lasted longest. The quality of  his style makes him an artist without compare between Romanesque and Gothic art. His signed masterpiece is in the Cathedral of Parma, however, stylistic analysis clearly proves that Antelami worked also in the Baptistery with his assistants.
./images/993.jpg	ANTELAMI, Benedetto	Stone	
./images/994.jpg	ANTELAMI, Benedetto	Marble	The sculptural decorations, whose program depicts the importance of the Birth of Christ for humankind's salvation, are by Antelami and his workshop. The relief of the Descent from the Cross, originally part of the cathedral's choir screen or pulpit, is the earliest work of his that we know of. The scene is framed by a broad vine scroll band in the niello technique. It is divided into three groups, the central one being the recovery of the body. On the left, lined up in the manner of a procession, are the mourners together with the personification of Ecclesia, and on the right stepped in two levels, is a procession of male Jews, and in front of them soldiers with Synagoga, throwing dice for Christ's robes.Antelami's work constitutes an important body of Romanesque sculpture in Italy. Aspects of his stylistic innovation have been imitated on several occasions, his legacy can be found in the work of Nicola Pisano and his pupil Arnolfo di Cambio.
./images/995.jpg	ANTELAMI, Benedetto	Marble	The first known work by Antelami is this Deposition on the pulpit of the Cathedral of Parma. Antelami's rigorous and severe style has roots in Provencal sculpture and particularly in the conception of statuary inherited from antiquity. The Virgin, St John, and the Holy Women, standing one behind the other, are clearly set off from the background, and the drapery folds are chiselled into the marble with a precision suggesting the art of the bronzeworker or goldsmith. Antelami disregards picturesque, anecdotal, or formal devices; his compact, firm forms have affinities with classical antiquity. Only the bowed heads and a restrained gesture of the hands evoke the pathos of the scene.

./images/999.jpg	ANTELAMI, Benedetto	Stone	The main surviving monument by Antelami is the Baptistery at Parma. This is a massive octogonal building, not in the least Gothic in its general appearence, although the interior is roofed with a ribbed vault. Whether Antelami designed it is not certain, but he was certainly responsible for the portals, since it is on one of these that his name appears. These portals are for their date unique in Italy in that they describe an ambitious and coherent iconographic programme. This prompts comparison with France, for it was only in France that such thought had been given to the programmatic content of the church portal.Two of the three portals are devoted to subjects familiar from France - the Virgin and the Last Judgment. However, the architectural layout can be derived not from France but from previous north Italian sources. The style of the sculpture is entirely that of the area, the figures being solid with rather large round heads. There are no column figures.
