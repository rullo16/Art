Aachen gives the mythological figures the facial features of his family: his own, his wife and their son. The motif could allude to the famous picture of the Greek painter Zeuxis. He painted a boy with grapes so naturally that the birds pecked at the painted fruits.The nude figure of a woman viewed from behind, a favourite motif in Rudolfine art, is represented here in a sensually suggestive way. The elongation of the female body is characteristic of the excessively refined Mannerist art and culture prevalent at the court in Prague c. 1600 and can also be found in the work of von Aachen's contemporaries at court, Bartholom‰us Spranger and Joseph Heintz the Elder.

The Emperor gathered together important artists: painters, sculptors, goldsmiths, who developed a characteristic style as important as that of the Fontainebleau school flowered at the same period in France. One component of the Rudolphean style was the painting of the Flemish Spranger, another the German Hans von Aachen and the third the Swiss Joseph Heintz.Aachen studied in Italy, he spent there 14 years and was known as a portraitist. He went to Munich and worked for the Bavarian Prince. He moved to Prague in 1592 and became court painter at the court of Rudolph II.In addition to mythological subjects he painted realistic genre pictures with two-three figures.

He became King of Hungary in 1572 and King of Bohemia in 1575. Following the death of his father he also became Holy Roman Emperor and Archduke of Austria. His reign was a troubled time of great religious conflicts coupled with the external menace of the Turks. Unfortunately, politics was not a great interest of his. Instead he was familiar with a number of languages and was devoted to art and science, the latter including alchemy and astrology, a highly fashionable preoccupation at that time. He was also fascinated by magic and the occult. At the end of the 1590s mental illness rendered him incapable of governing his empire, which by that time was torn by disputes between Reformation and Counter-Reformation movements. As a result, in 1611, he was forced to cede the crown of Bohemia to his brother Matthias and he died soon afterwards.

His earliest self-portrait was executed c. 1574, and he painted several other self-portraits during his career.

In the acutely observed flowers the artist has demonstrated his skills as an observer of nature, but in the more distant landscape. The two figures, possibly lovers, are framed by the forward garland but are almost incidental to the composition.
7	8	./images/8.jpg	ABADIA, Juan de la	(active 1470-1490 in Huesca)	The Archangel Michael	c. 1490	Wood, 127 x 78 cm	Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya, Barcelona	painting	religious	Spanish	1451-1500	The archangel Michael was, like St. George the dragon-killer, one of the typically warlike saints so greatly approved in the age of chivalry. The Bible tells us that he fought with Satan for the body of Moses and we can read in the Apocalypse how he defeated the dragon with seven heads and ten horns. St. Michael was therefore looked upon as one of the principal patrons of the Church who, having overcome Satan, could protect all innocent souls from the Devil.This painting illustrates the somewhat provincial style of Juan de la Abadia of Huesca. The heritage of the Trecento can be seen in the delicate, girlish countenance of the saint and the brilliant tints of the wings, but blended with it is the elegance associated with the International Gothic style. The figures are wooden and lifeless and the artist's limited knowledge of anatomy may be seen in his representation of the soul; but the carefully arranged pattern of the floor creates the illusion of space, indicating that the artist was aware of the later developments of Gothic art and was to some extent influenced by early Renaissance art.

The very small size of the figures in the foreground does not prevent the artist from lingering over every detail of the elegant clothing, the hairstyles and the harness of the horses. We sense a refined climate of diversion that was certainly inspired by  the Estense court of the castle of Ferrara, from which ""Camerini"" this painting probably comes. The natural scenery, which shows the influence of Dosso Dossi's landscapes and numerous aspects of Flemish art, is lit up in the background by unreal flashes of light, oscillating between pale pink and gray-green, from which ruins emerge, the spires of fairytale works of architecture."

To this and he imported such major artists as he could. He did get the aging Leonardo, he imported Rosso in 1530, Primaticcio in 1532, then NiccolÚ dell'Abbate, Vignola, Andrea del Sarto, Cellini. Some stayed, some went back; but the work they left behind was decisive in the replacement of Gothic style in France.The Fontainebleau decorations included a Long Gallery, a Ballroom and several royal rooms. Only a fraction survives, since much were destroyed in later rebuildings, and most of the paintings were drastically restored in the nineteenth century.NiccolÚ dell'Abbate arrived about 1552. His main contribution was his fantastic landscapes, which are a genre quite apart from either the poetic realism found in late fifteenth-century Italian pictures, or the homely kind in the background of the Raphael cartoons. They have a dreamlike quality with extremes of light and colour, rainbows and flickering storms.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 7 minutes):Cristoph Willibald Gluck: Orfeo, Act I, Orpheus' aria in G Major

That movement provided the political and cultural backdrop for one of the most important and influential groups in Italian art in the second half of the nineteenth century: the Macchiaioli. This group of landscape, portrait and genre painters, flourishing from about 1850 to 1880, was based on Florence. The core of the Macchiaioli consisted of eleven painters born between 1824 and 1838, most important of them among the older painters were Giovanni Fattori, Silvestro Lega, Serafino de Tivoli, and Vincenzo Cabianca, while Giuseppe Abbati and Telemaco Signorini belonged to the younger. There were some other artists associated with the group to varying extent, such as Guglielmo Ciardi, Giuseppe de Nittis, Federigo Zandomeneghi, and Giovanni Boldini. The last-named three all took their bearings from France, and eventually moved to Paris.Alongside history paintings, the early period of the Macchiaioli notably included the Castiglioncello School of landscape art, of significance in the 1860s in particular. (The school was named after the Tuscan coastal town where the artists gathered to work.) The painters of this school, among them Giuseppe Abbati, Odoardo Borrani, and Giovanni Fattori, constituted a homogenous subgroup within the Macchiaioli. At first Abbati's art was to the fore, subsequently that of Fattori.Abbati was very taken with the clear, serene light of that part of the country, and with the colours, and he was the most regular of the visitors. A typical painting of the 1860s was his Landscape at Castiglioncello.

Abbati chose a patch of sandy, yellow road for the foreground, where long afternoon shadows are casting the shades of other cypress trees to be imagined outside of the picture plane. Large areas of different hues are effectively played off against one another in a rather abstract fashion.

Numerous black and white marble blocks were strewn around the grounds, offering clear-cut shapes and sharp, elementary contrasts. Beyond the empty foreground, a row of stones is placed against the shaded walkway of the cloisters, with only the figure of a worker or stonemason as a living element in this rather abstract composition.

The composition focuses on her long, bluish dress and the bonnet, held down by a black scarf, while her features are only summarily executed in large daubs of colours.

The most famous of these are the ones created by Pietro da Cortona for the forty-hour prayer in Rome's San Lorenzo in Damaso during Holy Week in 1633. Drawings and engravings of these temporary ""sacred sets"" are the earliest evidence of the increasing tendency in the seventeenth century to transform church spaces into stages for heavenly apparitions and visions. One of the first decorations belonging to this category was the Cornaro Chapel in Santa Maria della Vittoria in Rome, designed by Gian Lorenzo Bernini. In it architecture, sculpture, and painting combine to form a theatrical whole. The saint and the angel in the famous Ecstasy of St Teresa function as the performers, while the saint's vision is entrusted to the medium of fresco, executed by Guido Ubaldo Abbatini."

He is best known as the pioneer of the coloured wax relief portrait miniature.He worked in Italy between 1552 and 1565, and thereafter mainly for the Habsburgs. His son Alessandro followed in his father's footsteps, also specializing in mythological reliefs, and marrying the widow of another court artist, Hans von Aachen.Thirteen of Abondio's wax portraits survive, and about sixty medals. He also made the dies for the first coinage of Emperor Rudolf II. Initially his style in metal followed that of Leone Leoni, for the faÁade of whose house in Milan he carved eight large atlantes in stone, but later included many other influences.

The present landscape with huntsmen returning from the hunt was commissioned around 1828 as one of a pair of hunting pictures by Felix Georg von Voss, the owner of Schloss Schorssow whose family held substantial estates in Pomerania and Prussia. In the background of the picture is a large, nine-bay country house, shown from the south-east side across the lake identifiable as Schloss Schorssow, built on the banks of Lake Haussee in Pomerania in North-East Germany.

Works of art were now marketable items and this raised the issue of how to market them. Porcelain thus came to used as a medium for figurines. Although they were fragile, they had the advantage of possessing colours of permanent freshness. Bronze figurines were more costly, however, they were also more resistant to blow. The technique for manufacturing them was similar to that employed for biscuit. Adam's Child was reproduced in a small size, in bronze rather than biscuit.

The huge lead group is all movement and action - Neptune poised as if about to rise and strike with his trident, and the whole rocky platform with its people and animals about to swing forward over the water.

His Neptune Calming the Waves reveals his ability and his limitations. Back in Paris from Rome in 1733, he completed a model the following year and the piece itself in 1737. Its debt to Bernini needs no emphasizing; nor does the piece, for all its bravura, survive too close a scrutiny of its movement and anatomy. But it has a compensating largeness of effect, despite its small scale, and a welcome vigour. It is a piece of illusionism, with its dramatic movement - Neptune advancing forward to quell the waves, instead of being balanced in the equilibrium Bernini had devised - and its bold flying swag of drapery which emphasises the action.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 3 minutes):Marc-Antoine Charpentier: Marche en Rondeau

The terracotta model for the head of Water in the Hermitage shows that the vein of poetry in Adam's 'fancy pieces' was very real. The limpid treatment of the hair, the ardent yet wistful gaze, reveal an unusual delicacy and response, perhaps more those of a modeller than a carver.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 28 minutes):George Frideric Handel: Water Music, Suite No. 1

They can be fairly judged by the bronze bas-reliefs each contributed to the chapel at Versailles, where the elder's St Adelaide taking leave of St Odilo is accomplished but fussy when compared to the clearly organized, highly pictorial Martyrdom of Sainte Victoire by Niclas-SÈbastien. He indeed practiced sometimes as a painter, and his orientation towards painting was apparent from his sculptural work. His bas-relief is almost a homage to Pietro da Cortona in composition, but executed in a fluent pastiche manner that is closer to Sebastiano RIcci. The dying heroine, the pagan altar, the dramatic action of the aged priest, and the whole classical atmosphere, are ready to be transmuted into another of the younger Adam's reliefs, that of Sacrifice of Iphigenia.
38	39	./images/39.jpg	ADAM, Nicolas-S√©bastien	(b. 1705, Nancy, d. 1778, Paris)	Monument to Queen Catharina Opalinska	1749	Marble	Notre-Dame de Bon Secours, Nancy	sculpture	religious	French	1701-1750	Nicolas-SÈbastien was the ideal choice for the tomb of Queen Catharina Opalinska, Queen of Poland and Duchess of Lorraine, set up in 1749 in the church of Bon Secours in his native Nancy. Nevertheless, his brother Lambert-Sigisbert struggled hard to be preferred to the task. But panache was not needed so much as lyricism and a gentle piety, in commemorating the quite unglamorous, humble, religious wife of Stanislas of Lorraine and mother of Marie Leczinska.Bon Secours had been built by Stanislas a few years before with the intention of its containing tombs of himself and his wife, and the church's title might have suggested to Adam the theme he was to illustrate in his touching masterpiece of a soul helped by a vision. The useless royal crown and sceptre, which had proved so barren in life, are deliberately laid aside at the moment of passing from death into immortality. The queen, made youthful again, kneels in prayer, while an angel points her way to heaven. The eagle of Poland, the incense burners that smoke with the queen's praises, are unimportant in the central depiction of a simple allegory.The juxtaposition of the person commemorated and the angel of immortality is not dramatic. In that lack of drama lies its whole point. The hand of the Lord, the revelation of eternal happiness, cannot startle someone who has waited so long for them. The queen's face expresses no surprise, only ecstasy. The angel and she are integrated into a single form, in effect a bas-relief set against the coloured marble of the pyramid; its steep lines are broken by the long undulating diagonal that runs up from the lowest fold in the queen's mantle and culminates in the extended forefinger of the angel's upraised hand.

Prometheus, the artist's presentation piece for the Academy in 1737, reveals a facile inspiration, great technical skill ostentatiously displayed, and a real sense for the decorative. His Triumph of Neptune and Amphitrite at Versailles, created with his brother Nicolas-Sebastian, is an exemplary work of French Rococo sculptural style.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 13 minutes):Franz Liszt: Prometheus, symphonic poem

Nicolas-SÈbastien Adam spent two decades working on the presentation piece he submitted to the Royal Academy in 1762. Yet there is not a trace of weariness in his masterpiece. It has a wonderful verve, yet it is also wonderfully delicate, this miniature Prometheus on his rock having his liver devoured by a vulture. The treatment of the details, even peripheral ones like the torch smoking on the ground, is superb. There is no question that academic statuettes of this type were influential.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 17 minutes):Karl Goldmark: Prometheus Bound, overture op.38

The sculptors Jean-Baptiste Pigalle and Nicolas-SÈbastien Adam each carved one on the theme of autumn (now both in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), and the Flemish-born sculptor Jacques Verberckt (1704-1771) carved the pair dedicated to spring (now in the MusÈe du Louvre, Paris, and in the Ch‚teau de Malmaison).Like many garden ornaments of the period of Louis XIV and Louis XV, the vases are indebted to ancient precedent. The kalyx-krater form, based on an ancient Greek vase type, with fluted base and handles springing from satyrs' heads, became a paradigm for Baroque and Rococo garden ornaments.

The house was designed by the Palladian architects James Paine (1717-1789) and Matthew Brettingham (1699-1769) and was loosely based on an original plan by Andrea Palladio for the never-built Villa Mocenigo. At the time a relatively unknown architect, Robert Adam was designing some garden temples to enhance the landscape of the park; Curzon was so impressed with Adam's designs, that Adam was quickly put in charge of the construction of the new mansion.The picture shows the south front.

The Tuscan activities of this Lombard painter contributed to the establishing of modern Nea-Classical aesthetics in Florence. His decorative scenographic paintings on subjects drawn from mythology and Greek and Roman history, rich in grandiloquent archeologisms. certainly produced responses from local artists. Two representative examples of Ademollo's style and language are the painting decoration of the Palatine Chapel (1791-92) and of the later (1816) Sala dell'Arca (Room of the Ark) in the Pitti palace.Ademollo decorated the Room of the Ark with biblical scenes inspired by the history surrounding the Holy Ark of the Jewish people. Before the backdrop of classical architecture, a multitude of people are moving in a frieze-like procession with the Holy Ark being carried under the leadership of the high priest. The scenes are rich in narrative detail and reveal the artist's ability for elaborate historical recreations.

He is most famous for his role in the Anglo-Dutch Wars of the 17th century. His victories in the naval battles of the Dutch War of Independence and later during the Anglo-Dutch wars assured his place not only as a national hero, but also as one of the most respected admirals in history. His greatest military achievement was the Four Days' Battle of June 1666, which resulted in defeat for the English navy. De Ruyter was then asked to commission his own portrait in six copies, to be hung in the chambers of the regional offices of the admiralty in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Middelburg, Harlingen, Enkhuizen and Hoorn.The medal is signed on the arm with the monogram 'C.AD.F.'.

He made a number of still-lifes of flowers, but he owes his reputation to his many still-lifes of fish. He depicted with great skill the moist waxiness of fish and oysters.He seems to have arrived fairly quickly at a well-laid-out scheme to which he adhered for the rest of his life. He has a striking diagonal asymmetric composition, with motifs overlapping one another and arranged over several planes, with a generally sober tonality, even tending to monochrome. In the use of some motifs he seems to have been influenced by Frans Snyders.

A gifted humanist prince, Ferdinand was loved by the people, who affectionately addressed him in the diminutive Ferrandino. When his father, the unpopular Alfonso II, became king (1494), Ferdinand took command of Neapolitan troops opposing the advance of the French king Charles VIII in northern Italy. Failing to halt the French, Ferdinand returned to Naples and became king upon the abdication of his father on Jan. 23, 1495. The following month, however, the French captured Naples, and Ferdinand withdrew to Sicily. Aided by a Spanish army and the Venetian fleet, he recovered almost all his lands by the summer of 1496 and was received triumphantly by the populace of Naples. His sudden death opened the way for Spanish usurpation of the Neapolitan throne.The reverse of the medal depicts Felicitas Seated, Holding Ears of Corn and Waving Cornucopiae.

Giovanni Gioviano Pontano (1429-1503) was a poet, humanist, and statesman. He was the presiding spirit of the Accademia Pontaniana, and chief minister and tutor to the Aragonese Kings of Naples. He was also the most innovative and versatile Latin poet of Quattrocento Italy. His Two Books of Hendecasyllables, given the subtitle Baiae by their first editor Pietro Summonte, experiment brilliantly with the metrical form associated principally with the ancient Latin poet Catullus. The poems are the elegant offspring of Pontano's leisure, written to celebrate love, good wine, friendship, nature, and all the pleasures of life to be found at the seaside resort of Baiae on the Bay of Naples.In all three forms, Adriano depicts Pontano as an older man, his sparse remaining hair is wavy, and his rather severe demeanour is expressed through a furrowed brow, pronounced veins and perhaps a scar at the temples, deeply creased cheeks, and a slightly downturned mouth. In the bust and relief he wears classical garb, with his cloak held at the shoulder by a fibula.

The fly on the light-coloured feathers has an illusionist effect: disproportionately large in size, it belongs to the realistic level of the picture rather than its fictitious one, so that the viewer is given the impression that a real fly is crawling across the painting. The bird's head has been pressed slightly towards the middle by the blue hunting bag with the golden fringe and the adjustable shoulder strap which is lying on the stone shelf. Beside the partridge a hunting horn, also adorned with tassels, and a powder bottle have been hung up. The shiny, metallic grey of the hunting horn has been painted by the artist with a highly sensitive eye for the different hues of the bird's fluffy, grey feathers on its breast and as a contrast to the grey of the wings which merges into white towards the middle.But, although the bird has been rendered with almost unsurpassable precision, it has an odd abstract quality. It seems as if, in its material consistency, it had undergone a synthesis with the implement of civilization by which it was pursued - as if it was no longer merely part of nature and a victim, but an aesthetically refined and ennobled form of existence.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 9 minutes):Antonio Vivaldi: Concerto in B flat major RV 362 op. 8 No. 10 (Hunt)

He also painted a number of elegant game pictures in a clear light. They show close views of dead prey - occasionally accompanied by killed poultry - that include scrupulously painted guns, hunting bags and horns, bells and other gear of the sport. As most trophy pieces they were designed as representative pictures of the sport, not records of the spoils of a specific hunt.In this picture the painter displayed the finely worked equipment of the huntsman on a marble ledge: a velvet hunting bag with chamois strap, trimmed with gold embroidery and fringes, and a tasseled horn. Above it he suspended the exquisite catch of a fat partridge and three small game birds. The exquisite blue of the velvet contains the expensive pigment lapis lazuli, which yields ultramarine colour when ground. It was imported from China. Van Aelst's lavish use of it reinforces the preciousness of the arrangement and confirms its destination in a wealthy home. Most Dutch painters used cheaper, less stable blue pigments.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 3 minutes):Carl Maria von Weber: Der Freisch¸tz, Act III: Jagerchor

It is possible, that this painting was executed for the cardinal, who was the artist's main patron in Florence.In this still-life Van AElst continues the tradition of fruit and flower painting that flourished in Delft from the early 1630s onward with the work of Balthasar van der Ast, Gillis de Bergh, and Evert van Aelst, Willem's uncle.

In this painting, which was commissioned by Cardinal Giovan Carlo de' Medici, the intense blue of the table-cloth catches one's eye. The large crystal vase in the centre of the composition was probably in the possession of the Medici family. The painter placed his signature and the date on the hem of the white tablecloth: W.A.Aelst. 1652.

In this composition the roses, carnations, thistles, peonies, the green leaves and stems tumble out of the glass vase in a haphazard fashion. This arrangement gives the subject volume and creates a natural setting. Van Aelst has silhouetted the objects against a dark background. The flowers, glass vase, velvet and the marble are bathed in a sharp light from the left which accentuates the textures and colours of these lustrous items.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 7 minutes):Piotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky: The Nutcracker, ballet suite, op. 71, Waltz of the Flowers

The subject here is a 'vanitas', with a recently extinguished candle set in a holder on a stone ledge, and a mouse nibbling at walnut crumbs.Although mice occur in 17th-century still-lifes (e.g. in paintings by Abraham van Beyeren, Georg Flegel, Jacob Vosmaer), the specific combination of a mouse and an expired candle is unique.

Here, he perhaps suggests the category's classical roots: the Greek painter Zeuxis's grapes, so lifelike that birds tried to eat them, and the split pomegranate recalling Demeter's bargain, and announcing winter's return, as Proserpina descends to Hades once more.

The eminent flower painter Rachel Ruysch was his pupil.This floral still-life has symbolic significance. The blooms, shown in all their glory, already imply the fading and dying that is to come, a reminder of the transience of beauty. A similar idea is communicated by the holes eaten in the leaves, while the open pocket-watch serves to suggest the passage of earthly time, as well as standing more generally for the importance of good measure. Yet the hour cannot be read from the face of the watch, and this might suggest that time is not passing, that the painter has brought time to a standstill in his work, overcoming the very transience of things.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 2 minutes):Franz Schubert: Blumenlied (Flower Song) D 431

Susanna and the Elders comes from the circle of Aert van Ort and it illustrates the opening episode of the Old Testament story in which the beautiful and virtuous Susanna attracts the lustful attention of two elders. This was probably paired with another window or two illustrating the story's conclusion. Hundreds of roundels survive, suggesting that this form of relatively inexpensive domestic art enjoyed great popularity.

His market scenes are not slices of everyday life, but plausible inventions. Many of the fruit and vegetables depicted in his work have sexual connotations and some of them were eaten as aphrodisiacs.In the present painting, the artist juxtaposes the biblical narrative with a market scene, encouraging beholders to ponder the relationship between love and lust, between sexual attraction and visual seduction. The foreground of the painting is filled with sexual innuendoes. On the left side, a man shows a woman his strings of onions. Although this may look innocent and mundane, onions were commonly used as aphrodisiacs. Furthermore, according to proverbial folklore, peeling an onion was like peeling off clothes, for it could easily result in tears. On the right, a man grasps a black rooster, a phallic allusion, in one hand, and an egg basket, a vaginal allusion, in the other.

In the area around this town there was an extensive cottage industry for the processing of English cloth and the production of glassware, soap, sugar, and other goods. The changing conditions in agriculture were almost equally revolutionary. The population increase at the beginning of the 16th century meant a greater demand for food, which had to be satisfied buy an agricultural system that was now no longer catering merely to itself but also to the market.After years of inadequate supplies the increase in food production was experienced by the general public as a great improvement - so much so, in fact, that it virtually demanded some form of artistic expression. Celebrating this new wealth in an almost solemn manner, the Amsterdam-born painter Pieter Artsen, who lived in Antwerp in 1555-56, depicted market scenes as part of biblical illustrations. However, instead of following traditional conventions and playing only a minor part in these illustrations, these market scenes dominate the biblical motifs so much that the latter are literally pushed into the background.In this painting Christ and the Adulteress, the biblical event takes place at the back, on the left, while the foreground is dominated by a market scene with peasants offering clay pots, baskets laden with fruit, vegetables such as onions, carrots, cucumbers and cabbages, as well as eggs, loaves of bread and large jugs of milk. It is this foreground which attracts our attention. There is also a peculiar mixture of time levels: the biblical scenario (with people wearing the clothes of antiquity) and the contemporary market scene (with sixteenth-century peasants) are intricately interwoven, as is shown in the Roman soldiers storming past the market stall. The same feature can be found in numerous other paintings of Aertsen.

The sculptural silhouette with its powerful arms, its solid body and vigorously modelled face radiates a strong sense of assurance. The fact that she is looking towards the unseen part of the room suggests that something is going on there that the viewer is unable to see. Pieter Aertsen made use several times of this form of composition in which a single, solidly-built figure occupies the entire panel in a vertical format which accentuates his or her solidity. This is an invention by the artist, which although originating in the foregrounds of the works of Jan van Hemessen, has no real precedent in the Antwerp painting of the period.Even though he never painted a picture not containing a human figure, Pieter Aertsen played an essential role in the emergence of the still-life by granting a dominating place to objects and to victuals, which he represents in all their triviality. Whilst every element appears to have been observed with attention to real-life detail, the image has nonetheless been recomposed in the studio. What cook would place small fowls and a heavy leg of lamb on the same spit? We also find the same kitchen utensils, furniture and victuals, differently interlinked, in many of the artist's compositions. Whilst the household objects are drawn from life, the classical lines of the chimney are taken from the architectural treaty of the Italian Sebastiano Serlio, whom Aertsen would have known from the Antwerp edition of his works in 1549.The total absence of religious subject matter, which still underlay all genre scenes at the time, is another stroke of daring by the painter, even if 16th century viewers would have immediately recognised, in the cook, the Martha of the gospel narrative, who is busy preparing the meal whilst her sister Mary is listening to Christ's words. This image also has a moralising content and should be read as a warning against the dangers of the pleasures of the flesh, ""voluptas carnis""."

This picture shows a merry company at an egg dance. The object was to keep dance while kicking the egg round in a circle without breaking it, then covering it with a bowl, again using only one feet.

Before then scenes from everyday life had often been depicted in the background of pictures with a primarily religious content, but it was only after about the middle of the sixteenth century that many painters began to feel their principal task was to represent everyday life for its own sake. With Pieter Bruegel the Elder, also called Peasant Bruegel, genre painting came to be generally accepted and found a great many adherents in the Netherlands. Pieter Aertsen, who was born in Amsterdam and worked mainly in his native city and in Antwerp, was one of the most eminent of these. Most of his works depict market vendors, scenes at fairs or kitchen interiors, with an abundance of carefully painted still-life motifs.In this painting he depicts an old Dutch peasant taking his produce to the market, on his head a heavy tub, in his right hand a brace of mallard and a basket of eggs. A peasant girl in the background kneels by a tray of pasties or loaves. The painter has achieved an effect of monumentality by using large spots of colour and clear outlines and by enclosing his powerfully modelled figures within the confines of a narrow space. Aertsen's great virtue lies in his sincerity and simplicity, particularly noticeable if we compare his work with later genre-scenes.

Wedged between this enormous abundance of produce, the farmer and his wife appear to be mere appendages whose job is only that  of proudly pointing with silent gestures to the victuals that are on offer.The ostentatious wealth of fruit and vegetables in the market scenes of Aertsen and Beuckelaer may lead to the false conclusion that the population had plenty to eat. But although more was being offered on the markets, this did not meet the demands of the urban population, who had to pay exorbitant prices for agricultural produce in comparison to what they actually earned. And so, the horn-of-plenty motif of these market pictures reflects far more the perception of those who benefited, that is, the newly-rich farmers. In this way the artist emphasized the commercial aesthetics of agricultural products from the farmers' fields and gardens, products that were meant to arouse in the viewer the desire to buy, though not in the sense of present-day advertising.However, this does not exclude the possibility of ambivalent reasoning behind such paintings. While stimulating people's cravings and appealing to their needs, they often contained a subtle element of criticism, particularly in Aertsen's biblically motivated pictures. This criticism concerned the contradiction between people's consumer habits and the demand of temperance (""fasting""). While this critical element was still obvious in Aertsen's paintings, it seems to have disappeared almost completely in Beuckelaer's.This painting has a multiple theme. The abundance of the market could be at the same time a representation of the Four Elements and an allegory of the Five Senses. Also the market woman is being pestered by a bird-catcher, who is gripping a duck round the neck with obvious erotic overtones - as well as a realistic representation. The painting is also a moral lesson, extolling moderation and restraint in contrast to the physical and sensual pleasured offered, for instance, in the plumpness of the fruit. In other paintings Aertsen introduced a religious scene in the background by way of admonition."

Similarly to other biblical paintings of Aertsen, the biblical event takes place at the back, while the foreground is dominated by a market scene.. Somewhere in the background, the picture - cut off at the top - affords a small glimpse of the platform where the masses are shouting 'Barabbas' (John 19:4-6). This is optically overlaid by the bow-shaped arrangement of carts and market stalls - a reversal of emphasis which is typical of Aertsen.

Offering her fruits and vegetables, the woman is almost an appendage to her produce. Despite all exaggeration, the picture quite adequately shows the new economic prosperity of the time. At the same time, however, it still contains a background scene in genre style of embracing lovers in a stable, thus relating the painting to late medieval peasant satires. Peasants were regarded as lustful, sensuous and carnal by the middle classes.
109	110	./images/110.jpg	AERTSEN, Pieter	(b. 1508, Amsterdam, d. 1575, Amsterdam)	Butcher's Stall	1551	Oil on panel, 123 x 167 cm	Museum Gustavianum, Uppsala	painting	genre	Netherlandish	1501-1550	In the 16th and 17th centuries it was quite common for theologians to see a slaughtered animal as symbolizing the death of a believer. Allusions to the 'weak flesh' (cf. Matthew 16:41) may well have been associated with Aertsen's Butcher's Stall where - like on his fruit and vegetable stalls - a seemingly infinite abundance of meat has been spread out.In this picture, the viewer's senses are immediately assaulted by the profusion of life-size comestibles. Amid fowls, sausages, beef, pork, fish, butter, cheese and pretzel, the eye of a flayed ox's head disconcertingly seems to watch the viewer. Each object is a masterful still-life. Like Lucas van Leyden and some other Netherlandish artists, Aertsen inverted the traditional foreground-subject relationship; his narrative occurs in the background. Almost unnoticed at first, the stall permits glimpses of a tavern on the right and a landscape behind. The ground around the inn is covered with oyster and mussel shells, which in some context - as here - allude to their consumption as an aphrodisiac. Among the tavern's revellers is a prostitute with a possible customer.Meanwhile, groups of people, dressed in contemporary Netherlandish attire, walk through the countryside towards the church visible at the far left. Only the mother riding the donkey stops to give alms to the poor. She is the Virgin Mary. Led by Joseph, she and her son are journeying to Egypt, to escape Herod. This is a very different presentation than the standard flight into Egypt since no idols fall, no miracles occur, no angels or servants direct the way. Although beset by their own troubles, the Holy Family shares what they have with the less fortunate. No halos signal their divinity, rather, Aertsen accented their humanity to construct a moral about daily personal decisions. His pilgrimage of life offers a choice between a materialistic and morally questionable existence on the one hand and the spiritual path of the Holy Family on the other.Aertsen and Joachim Beuckelaer, his nephew and pupil, popularized peasant and market scenes such as this, which typically contain half-hidden moralizations and religious themes. Through their impetus in Antwerp and Amsterdam, where they painted, peasant and market scenes evolved into a separate artistic specialization around the mid-sixteenth century.
110	111	./images/111.jpg	AERTSEN, Pieter	(b. 1508, Amsterdam, d. 1575, Amsterdam)	Peasants by the Hearth	1560s	Oil on wood, 142,3 x 198 cm	Museum Mayer van den Bergh, Antwerp	painting	genre	Netherlandish	1501-1550	Pieter Aertsen was a Dutch painter who had a workshop in Antwerp for several years. He painted altarpieces, but also peasant scenes with a moralizing undertone and kitchen still-lifes with religious themes in the background. He continued this work following his return to Amsterdam in around 1557, concentrating henceforth more on the latter genre. This painting may have been produced during his Amsterdam period.The subject of the work has long been debated, although we can be sure it is not simply a peasant scene. it was once believed to be a portrait of the artist's family, but that hypothesis was rejected some time ago. The scene has all the elements of a rural booze-up. Much drink is being consumed, sausages grilled and bacon fried. There are festive biscuits on the table and a tray of waffles. Crowns like the one worn by the boy were used on the Feast of Epiphany, but also during other winter festivities, including Shrove Tuesday. Neither holiday is being celebrated here, however. The bird-cage next to the door on the left tells us that the scene is taking place in a house of ill repute, such as a tavern or brothel. Other elements combine to suggest the latter - the way the young man places his arm around the girl's waist, the copious eating and drinking, the aggression symbolized by the man with the two weapons, and the foolishness reflected by the king's crown. Like many of Aertsen's paintings, this work has both a moralizing and admonitory content, revealed by the presence of three men of different ages, each symbolizing a generation, around one woman.There is some remarkable innovation in this painting. The figures in the foreground are shown full-length in the middle of the small space, which, together with the monumental format, testifies to the emancipation of non-religious themes in painting around this period.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 26 minutes):Johann Sebastian Bach: Cantata BWV 212 (Bauernkantate)

On the reverse side of the left wing the scene of Circumcision (or the Presentation in the Temple) can be seen.

It was made for the Ospedale della Morte in Pistoia in 1495. Documents show that the officers of the Sapienza in Pistoia ordered a terracotta figure of Mary Magdalene to be made for the oratory attached to the Ospedale della Morte on August 16, 1495. A local master, Bernardino del Signoraccio, painted the figure next year, 1496.The figure suffered damage in 1498, and Agnolo repaired it in 1500 and replaced the broken right hand with one in wood.

Their principal surviving work, the Tarlati monument in the Duomo at Arezzo, was executed in the same bracket of years as Tino's Mary of Valois monument in Naples. But whereas the the Mary of Valois monument has its place in the context of court art, the Tarlati monument belongs in the democratic tradition of Tuscan sculpture. Lacking the refinement and elegance of Tino's tomb, it celebrates in simple, graphic style Tarlati's administration.
