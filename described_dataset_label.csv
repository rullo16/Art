./images/1.jpg	AACHEN, Hans von	Allegory	Oil on copper	The painting, displaying the characteristic Mannerist style of the artist, is also known as The Triumph of Justice.
./images/2.jpg	AACHEN, Hans von	Bacchus, Ceres and Cupid	Oil on canvas	The representation of this group is related to the frequently depicted sentence by Terence: Sine Cerere et Baccho friget Venus - Without Ceres (bread) and Bacchus (wine) Venus freezes. Aachen gives the mythological figures the facial features of his family: his own, his wife and their son. The motif could allude to the famous picture of the Greek painter Zeuxis. He painted a boy with grapes so naturally that the birds pecked at the painted fruits.The nude figure of a woman viewed from behind, a favourite motif in Rudolfine art, is represented here in a sensually suggestive way. The elongation of the female body is characteristic of the excessively refined Mannerist art and culture prevalent at the court in Prague c. 1600 and can also be found in the work of von Aachen's contemporaries at court, BartholomÃ¤us Spranger and Joseph Heintz the Elder.
./images/3.jpg	AACHEN, Hans von	Joking Couple	Copperplate	At the end of the 16th century the court of Emperor Rudolph II in Prague was one of the most important art and cultural centre of Europe. The Emperor gathered together important artists: painters, sculptors, goldsmiths, who developed a characteristic style as important as that of the Fontainebleau school flowered at the same period in France. One component of the Rudolphean style was the painting of the Flemish Spranger, another the German Hans von Aachen and the third the Swiss Joseph Heintz.Aachen studied in Italy, he spent there 14 years and was known as a portraitist. He went to Munich and worked for the Bavarian Prince. He moved to Prague in 1592 and became court painter at the court of Rudolph II.In addition to mythological subjects he painted realistic genre pictures with two-three figures.
./images/4.jpg	AACHEN, Hans von	Portrait of Emperor Rudolf II	Oil on canvas	Rudolf II (1552-1612) was the son of the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II. He became King of Hungary in 1572 and King of Bohemia in 1575. Following the death of his father he also became Holy Roman Emperor and Archduke of Austria. His reign was a troubled time of great religious conflicts coupled with the external menace of the Turks. Unfortunately, politics was not a great interest of his. Instead he was familiar with a number of languages and was devoted to art and science, the latter including alchemy and astrology, a highly fashionable preoccupation at that time. He was also fascinated by magic and the occult. At the end of the 1590s mental illness rendered him incapable of governing his empire, which by that time was torn by disputes between Reformation and Counter-Reformation movements. As a result, in 1611, he was forced to cede the crown of Bohemia to his brother Matthias and he died soon afterwards.
./images/5.jpg	AACHEN, Hans von	Self-Portrait with a Glass of Wine	Oil on canvas	Hans von Aachen was an artist who fully embraced the self-portrait as a means of artistic expression. His earliest self-portrait was executed c. 1574, and he painted several other self-portraits during his career.
./images/6.jpg	AAGAARD, Carl Frederik	Deer beside a Lake	Oil on canvas	The painting is signed and dated 'C F Aagaard 1888' at lower left.
./images/7.jpg	AAGAARD, Carl Frederik	The Rose Garden	Oil on canvas	This painting is unusual in 19th century art in combining landscape with still-life. In the acutely observed flowers the artist has demonstrated his skills as an observer of nature, but in the more distant landscape. The two figures, possibly lovers, are framed by the forward garland but are almost incidental to the composition.
./images/8.jpg	ABADIA, Juan de la	The Archangel Michael	Wood	The archangel Michael was, like St. George the dragon-killer, one of the typically warlike saints so greatly approved in the age of chivalry. The Bible tells us that he fought with Satan for the body of Moses and we can read in the Apocalypse how he defeated the dragon with seven heads and ten horns. St. Michael was therefore looked upon as one of the principal patrons of the Church who, having overcome Satan, could protect all innocent souls from the Devil.This painting illustrates the somewhat provincial style of Juan de la Abadia of Huesca. The heritage of the Trecento can be seen in the delicate, girlish countenance of the saint and the brilliant tints of the wings, but blended with it is the elegance associated with the International Gothic style. The figures are wooden and lifeless and the artist's limited knowledge of anatomy may be seen in his representation of the soul; but the carefully arranged pattern of the floor creates the illusion of space, indicating that the artist was aware of the later developments of Gothic art and was to some extent influenced by early Renaissance art.
./images/13.jpg	ABBATE, NiccolÃÂ² dell'	Chimney breast	-	The chimney breast was realized by the workshop of NiccolÃ² dell' Abbate. It features figures, putti, flowers, fruit, and symbols (among them the sword symbolizing the constable's office) in trompe-l'oeil painting.
./images/15.jpg	ABBATE, NiccolÃÂ² dell'	Stag Hunt	Oil on canvas	"In a fabulous setting we see the last moments of a stag hunt. The very small size of the figures in the foreground does not prevent the artist from lingering over every detail of the elegant clothing, the hairstyles and the harness of the horses. We sense a refined climate of diversion that was certainly inspired by  the Estense court of the castle of Ferrara, from which ""Camerini"" this painting probably comes. The natural scenery, which shows the influence of Dosso Dossi's landscapes and numerous aspects of Flemish art, is lit up in the background by unreal flashes of light, oscillating between pale pink and gray-green, from which ruins emerge, the spires of fairytale works of architecture."
./images/16.jpg	ABBATE, NiccolÃÂ² dell'	Orpheus and Eurydice	Oil on canvas	King Francis I of France concentrated his patronage of art and artists on the decoration of the Chateau of Fontainebleau. To this and he imported such major artists as he could. He did get the aging Leonardo, he imported Rosso in 1530, Primaticcio in 1532, then NiccolÃ² dell'Abbate, Vignola, Andrea del Sarto, Cellini. Some stayed, some went back; but the work they left behind was decisive in the replacement of Gothic style in France.The Fontainebleau decorations included a Long Gallery, a Ballroom and several royal rooms. Only a fraction survives, since much were destroyed in later rebuildings, and most of the paintings were drastically restored in the nineteenth century.NiccolÃ² dell'Abbate arrived about 1552. His main contribution was his fantastic landscapes, which are a genre quite apart from either the poetic realism found in late fifteenth-century Italian pictures, or the homely kind in the background of the Raphael cartoons. They have a dreamlike quality with extremes of light and colour, rainbows and flickering storms.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 7 minutes):Cristoph Willibald Gluck: Orfeo, Act I, Orpheus' aria in G Major
./images/17.jpg	ABBATE, NiccolÃÂ² dell'	The Rape of Proserpine	Oil on canvas	In this painting - which may belong to a series of landscapes painted in 1570 for the Cabinet du Roi in the ChÃ¢teau de Fontainebleau - the artist applies the formula of a vast landscape animated by small, graceful figures. He takes as his source works by Joachim Patenier.
./images/18.jpg	ABBATE, NiccolÃÂ² dell'	The Continence of Scipio	Oil on canvas	This painting is typical of the elegant art emerging in Fontainebleau inspired by Primaticcio.
./images/19.jpg	ABBATI, Giuseppe	Landscape at Castiglioncello	Oil on panel	The mid-nineteenth century in Italy was the period of the Risorgimento, the movement that culminated in Italian unification. That movement provided the political and cultural backdrop for one of the most important and influential groups in Italian art in the second half of the nineteenth century: the Macchiaioli. This group of landscape, portrait and genre painters, flourishing from about 1850 to 1880, was based on Florence. The core of the Macchiaioli consisted of eleven painters born between 1824 and 1838, most important of them among the older painters were Giovanni Fattori, Silvestro Lega, Serafino de Tivoli, and Vincenzo Cabianca, while Giuseppe Abbati and Telemaco Signorini belonged to the younger. There were some other artists associated with the group to varying extent, such as Guglielmo Ciardi, Giuseppe de Nittis, Federigo Zandomeneghi, and Giovanni Boldini. The last-named three all took their bearings from France, and eventually moved to Paris.Alongside history paintings, the early period of the Macchiaioli notably included the Castiglioncello School of landscape art, of significance in the 1860s in particular. (The school was named after the Tuscan coastal town where the artists gathered to work.) The painters of this school, among them Giuseppe Abbati, Odoardo Borrani, and Giovanni Fattori, constituted a homogenous subgroup within the Macchiaioli. At first Abbati's art was to the fore, subsequently that of Fattori.Abbati was very taken with the clear, serene light of that part of the country, and with the colours, and he was the most regular of the visitors. A typical painting of the 1860s was his Landscape at Castiglioncello.
./images/20.jpg	ABBATI, Giuseppe	Country Road with Cypresses	Oil on canvas	To this day, the hilly Tuscan countryside is dotted with olive groves and ominous cypress trees, frequently found along roadsides and near cemeteries. Abbati chose a patch of sandy, yellow road for the foreground, where long afternoon shadows are casting the shades of other cypress trees to be imagined outside of the picture plane. Large areas of different hues are effectively played off against one another in a rather abstract fashion.
./images/21.jpg	ABBATI, Giuseppe	Cloister	Oil on cardboard	Abbati painted in the cloisters of Santa Croce in Florence in 1861-62 while the monument was being restored. Numerous black and white marble blocks were strewn around the grounds, offering clear-cut shapes and sharp, elementary contrasts. Beyond the empty foreground, a row of stones is placed against the shaded walkway of the cloisters, with only the figure of a worker or stonemason as a living element in this rather abstract composition.
./images/22.jpg	ABBATI, Giuseppe	Portrait of a Woman	Oil on panel	More a genre painting than a portrait, this woman is standing near a fireplace resting her hands on the back of a chair, a pose that was customary in portrait photography at that time. The composition focuses on her long, bluish dress and the bonnet, held down by a black scarf, while her features are only summarily executed in large daubs of colours.
./images/23.jpg	ABBATINI, Guido Ubaldo	Gian Lorenzo Bernini's Cornaro Chapel	Oil on canvas	"In Rome it was customary to decorate church choirs on high church holidays with temporary decorations constructed of coloured papier mÃ¢chÃ© or canvas. The most famous of these are the ones created by Pietro da Cortona for the forty-hour prayer in Rome's San Lorenzo in Damaso during Holy Week in 1633. Drawings and engravings of these temporary ""sacred sets"" are the earliest evidence of the increasing tendency in the seventeenth century to transform church spaces into stages for heavenly apparitions and visions. One of the first decorations belonging to this category was the Cornaro Chapel in Santa Maria della Vittoria in Rome, designed by Gian Lorenzo Bernini. In it architecture, sculpture, and painting combine to form a theatrical whole. The saint and the angel in the famous Ecstasy of St Teresa function as the performers, while the saint's vision is entrusted to the medium of fresco, executed by Guido Ubaldo Abbatini."

./images/32.jpg	ADAM, Albrecht	The Return from the Hunt	Oil on canvas	Albrecht Adam was one of the most celebrated German equestrian and military artists of the early nineteenth century. The present landscape with huntsmen returning from the hunt was commissioned around 1828 as one of a pair of hunting pictures by Felix Georg von Voss, the owner of Schloss Schorssow whose family held substantial estates in Pomerania and Prussia. In the background of the picture is a large, nine-bay country house, shown from the south-east side across the lake identifiable as Schloss Schorssow, built on the banks of Lake Haussee in Pomerania in North-East Germany.
./images/51.jpg	ADEMOLLO, Luigi	View of the Room of the Ark	Fresco	Luigi Ademollo, an Italian painter, draftsman, and engraver, was the uncle of the painter Carlo Ademollo (1825-1911). The Tuscan activities of this Lombard painter contributed to the establishing of modern Nea-Classical aesthetics in Florence. His decorative scenographic paintings on subjects drawn from mythology and Greek and Roman history, rich in grandiloquent archeologisms. certainly produced responses from local artists. Two representative examples of Ademollo's style and language are the painting decoration of the Palatine Chapel (1791-92) and of the later (1816) Sala dell'Arca (Room of the Ark) in the Pitti palace.Ademollo decorated the Room of the Ark with biblical scenes inspired by the history surrounding the Holy Ark of the Jewish people. Before the backdrop of classical architecture, a multitude of people are moving in a frieze-like procession with the Holy Ark being carried under the leadership of the high priest. The scenes are rich in narrative detail and reveal the artist's ability for elaborate historical recreations.

This shows the preparation of a Jewish festivity that is about to take place under a tentlike structure. Baskets of bread and jars of wine are being set up for distribution to the crowds during the celebration. The display of the massive menorah, a golden candelabrum with seven arms, serves as the dominating symbol of the Jewish people.

Billowing clouds of aromatic incense surround the Ark of the Covenant, which is being carried in a solemn procession into the city of Jerusalem. The high priest of the Temple leads the pageant with the tabernacle containing the sacred Tablets of the Law.
./images/55.jpg	ADEMOLLO, Luigi	View of the Palatine Chapel	Fresco	The decorations of the chapel in the Palazzo Pitti are due to Luigi Ademollo, who painted the religious panels as well as the simulated bas-reliefs in grisaille technique of the organ balcony. They represent the Neoclassical taste of the early years of the nineteenth century, when for some time Napoleon had installed members of his family as the rulers of Tuscany.

During the Restoration he was a governor and lieutenant-general of the Lorraine grand duke of Tuscany. The building of the palazzo was designed to mirror the personality, celebrating the features of Neo-classical art, beauty and grace, as the criteria of grandeur.The interior has a suite of rooms on the 'piano Mobile' which rejoices in the frescoes of Luigi Ademollo: they breathe the grace and Olympian calm of the Greek and Roman myths, The Marriage of Alexander and Roxana, and The Sacrifices of Numa. In contrast with these is the 'forest room' where a decoration of buildings and scenes of nature merges into endless greenery, creating illusory scenic prospects that rise to the changing sky of the ceiling and are lost in the dream-like images of the garden outside.The picture shows a detail of the decoration of the rooms on the piano nobile of the palazzo, entirely frescoed by Ademollo with mythological subjects, including griffins and garlands of flowers, and some 'woodland' decoration from a series of trompe-l'oeil landscapes.

./images/65.jpg	ADRIAENSSEN, Alexander	Still-Life with Fish	Oil on oak panel	The style of Alexander Adriaenssen, who became a master in Antwerp in 1610, is related to the Haarlem style. He made a number of still-lifes of flowers, but he owes his reputation to his many still-lifes of fish. He depicted with great skill the moist waxiness of fish and oysters.He seems to have arrived fairly quickly at a well-laid-out scheme to which he adhered for the rest of his life. He has a striking diagonal asymmetric composition, with motifs overlapping one another and arranged over several planes, with a generally sober tonality, even tending to monochrome. In the use of some motifs he seems to have been influenced by Frans Snyders.
./images/67.jpg	ADRIAENSSEN, Alexander	Still-Life	Oil on panel	The painting shows a still-life with a platter of crabs and shrimp, a glass jug of flowers, a Roemer and a long-stemmed tazza of wine, an earthenware jug, a loaf of bread, a bunch of grapes and a half-peeled lemon.All of Adriaenssen's known works are still-lifes, a number of which are dated and prominently signed with his full name.  His compositions are well balanced, suffused with soft chiaroscuro, with the textures of surfaces skillfully and convincingly reproduced.The painting is signed and dated on the table, lower left: Alex. Adriaenssen fecit Ao 1646.
./images/68.jpg	ADRIAENSSEN, Alexander	Still-Life with Oysters	Oil on oak panel	In this painting the stylistic elements of both the Flemish and the Dutch seventeenth-century painting can be observed. The colour palette is close to that of the Haarlem painters active around 1630.
./images/75.jpg	AELST, Willem van	Breakfast Piece	Oil on canvas	"Willem van Aelst signed and dated this ""Ontbijtje"" (breakfast piece)."
./images/76.jpg	AELST, Willem van	Still-Life with Hunting Equipment and Dead Birds	Oil on canvas	In addition to fruit and flower still-lifes with cool colour harmonies, van Aelst also enjoyed painting elegant hunting weapons and dead animals placed in a dark corner by a wall for rich clients. One example is this still-life.A dead partridge is hanging by its leg from a piece of string. Its wings and feathers, which are grey with brownish patches, open up towards us at the bottom like a fan. The fly on the light-coloured feathers has an illusionist effect: disproportionately large in size, it belongs to the realistic level of the picture rather than its fictitious one, so that the viewer is given the impression that a real fly is crawling across the painting. The bird's head has been pressed slightly towards the middle by the blue hunting bag with the golden fringe and the adjustable shoulder strap which is lying on the stone shelf. Beside the partridge a hunting horn, also adorned with tassels, and a powder bottle have been hung up. The shiny, metallic grey of the hunting horn has been painted by the artist with a highly sensitive eye for the different hues of the bird's fluffy, grey feathers on its breast and as a contrast to the grey of the wings which merges into white towards the middle.But, although the bird has been rendered with almost unsurpassable precision, it has an odd abstract quality. It seems as if, in its material consistency, it had undergone a synthesis with the implement of civilization by which it was pursued - as if it was no longer merely part of nature and a victim, but an aesthetically refined and ennobled form of existence.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 9 minutes):Antonio Vivaldi: Concerto in B flat major RV 362 op. 8 No. 10 (Hunt)
./images/77.jpg	AELST, Willem van	Hunting Still-Life	Oil on canvas	Willem van Aelst was a still-life specialist prized for his lovely flower and fruit pieces, and he has been mentioned as a sometime follower of Kalf. He also painted a number of elegant game pictures in a clear light. They show close views of dead prey - occasionally accompanied by killed poultry - that include scrupulously painted guns, hunting bags and horns, bells and other gear of the sport. As most trophy pieces they were designed as representative pictures of the sport, not records of the spoils of a specific hunt.In this picture the painter displayed the finely worked equipment of the huntsman on a marble ledge: a velvet hunting bag with chamois strap, trimmed with gold embroidery and fringes, and a tasseled horn. Above it he suspended the exquisite catch of a fat partridge and three small game birds. The exquisite blue of the velvet contains the expensive pigment lapis lazuli, which yields ultramarine colour when ground. It was imported from China. Van Aelst's lavish use of it reinforces the preciousness of the arrangement and confirms its destination in a wealthy home. Most Dutch painters used cheaper, less stable blue pigments.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 3 minutes):Carl Maria von Weber: Der FreischÃ¼tz, Act III: Jagerchor

./images/79.jpg	AELST, Willem van	Still-Life of Fruit	Oil on canvas	The picture depicts a still-life with peaches and grapes fallen from an over-turned basket, resting on a partly-draped marble ledge. The painting has been reduced from a vertical to horizontal format, resulting in the loss of the signature.
./images/80.jpg	AELST, Willem van	Still-Life with a Basket of Fruit on a Marble Ledge	Oil on canvas	Van Aelst painted this still-life (signed and dated lower right) in 1650, the year in which he entered the service of Ferdinand II de'Medici, grand duke of Toscany, and of his brother, Cardinal Carlo de'Medici. It is possible, that this painting was executed for the cardinal, who was the artist's main patron in Florence.In this still-life Van AElst continues the tradition of fruit and flower painting that flourished in Delft from the early 1630s onward with the work of Balthasar van der Ast, Gillis de Bergh, and Evert van Aelst, Willem's uncle.
./images/81.jpg	AELST, Willem van	Still-Life	Oil on canvas	This painting depicts a still-life of roses, a carnation and a sunflower in a glass vase, on a marble ledge.
./images/82.jpg	AELST, Willem van	Still-Life with Fruit	Oil on canvas	These peaches, grapes, and figs may be identified as products of the Medici estates.
./images/83.jpg	AELST, Willem van	Still-Life with Fruit and Crystal Vase	Oil on canvas	Intense colours characterize the still-lifes of Van Aelst, who worked for a time in France and Italy. In this painting, which was commissioned by Cardinal Giovan Carlo de' Medici, the intense blue of the table-cloth catches one's eye. The large crystal vase in the centre of the composition was probably in the possession of the Medici family. The painter placed his signature and the date on the hem of the white tablecloth: W.A.Aelst. 1652.
./images/84.jpg	AELST, Willem van	Still-Life	Oil on panel	Willem van Aelst painted a large variety of still-lifes including fruit still-lifes, flower bouquets in vases, as well as trophies of the hunt, banquet still-lifes, and also forest floor still-lifes in the tradition of his contemporary van Schriek.

./images/87.jpg	AELST, Willem van	Flower Still-Life	Oil on canvas	The present painting, treats one of Willem van Aelst's favourite themes of still-lifes of flowers. In this composition the roses, carnations, thistles, peonies, the green leaves and stems tumble out of the glass vase in a haphazard fashion. This arrangement gives the subject volume and creates a natural setting. Van Aelst has silhouetted the objects against a dark background. The flowers, glass vase, velvet and the marble are bathed in a sharp light from the left which accentuates the textures and colours of these lustrous items.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 7 minutes):Piotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky: The Nutcracker, ballet suite, op. 71, Waltz of the Flowers
./images/88.jpg	AELST, Willem van	Fruit Still-Life	Oil on canvas	Van Aelst painted fruit still-lifes for the Medici family in Italy and from 1659 onwards had begun to specifically focus on painting various arrangements of grapes and peaches, such as the present work which depicts peaches, chestnuts and grapes in an overturned basket resting on a partially draped marble ledge.
./images/89.jpg	AELST, Willem van	Still-Life with Fruit, Parrot, and Nautilus Pitcher	Oil on canvas	This princely still-life is one of several variations on a theme made for Grand Duke Ferdinando II de' Medici and his brothers. The good things in life here include natural beauty, crafted artisanship, and a combination of the two in the adorned nautilus shell.
./images/91.jpg	AELST, Willem van	Still-Life with Mouse and Candle	Oil on copper	Although Van Aelst is most admired for elegant still-lifes with fine glassware, silver vessels, fruit and flowers, this representation of humbler motifs must be considered one of his finest early work. The subject here is a 'vanitas', with a recently extinguished candle set in a holder on a stone ledge, and a mouse nibbling at walnut crumbs.Although mice occur in 17th-century still-lifes (e.g. in paintings by Abraham van Beyeren, Georg Flegel, Jacob Vosmaer), the specific combination of a mouse and an expired candle is unique.
./images/92.jpg	AELST, Willem van	Still-Life with Fruit and a Crystal Vase	Oil on canvas	Van Aelst's still-lifes are infinitely various. Here, he perhaps suggests the category's classical roots: the Greek painter Zeuxis's grapes, so lifelike that birds tried to eat them, and the split pomegranate recalling Demeter's bargain, and announcing winter's return, as Proserpina descends to Hades once more.
./images/93.jpg	AELST, Willem van	Vase of Flowers with Pocket Watch	Oil on canvas	Willem van Aelst was a still-life specialist prized for his lovely flower and fruit pieces, and he has been mentioned as a sometime follower of Kalf. The eminent flower painter Rachel Ruysch was his pupil.This floral still-life has symbolic significance. The blooms, shown in all their glory, already imply the fading and dying that is to come, a reminder of the transience of beauty. A similar idea is communicated by the holes eaten in the leaves, while the open pocket-watch serves to suggest the passage of earthly time, as well as standing more generally for the importance of good measure. Yet the hour cannot be read from the face of the watch, and this might suggest that time is not passing, that the painter has brought time to a standstill in his work, overcoming the very transience of things.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 2 minutes):Franz Schubert: Blumenlied (Flower Song) D 431

Many of the fruit and vegetables depicted in his work have sexual connotations and some of them were eaten as aphrodisiacs.In the present painting, the artist juxtaposes the biblical narrative with a market scene, encouraging beholders to ponder the relationship between love and lust, between sexual attraction and visual seduction. The foreground of the painting is filled with sexual innuendoes. On the left side, a man shows a woman his strings of onions. Although this may look innocent and mundane, onions were commonly used as aphrodisiacs. Furthermore, according to proverbial folklore, peeling an onion was like peeling off clothes, for it could easily result in tears. On the right, a man grasps a black rooster, a phallic allusion, in one hand, and an egg basket, a vaginal allusion, in the other.
./images/100.jpg	AERTSEN, Pieter	Christ and the Adulteress	Oil on wood	In the 16th century Antwerp rose to the position of the most significant trade and banking centre in Europe. In the area around this town there was an extensive cottage industry for the processing of English cloth and the production of glassware, soap, sugar, and other goods. The changing conditions in agriculture were almost equally revolutionary. The population increase at the beginning of the 16th century meant a greater demand for food, which had to be satisfied buy an agricultural system that was now no longer catering merely to itself but also to the market.After years of inadequate supplies the increase in food production was experienced by the general public as a great improvement - so much so, in fact, that it virtually demanded some form of artistic expression. Celebrating this new wealth in an almost solemn manner, the Amsterdam-born painter Pieter Artsen, who lived in Antwerp in 1555-56, depicted market scenes as part of biblical illustrations. However, instead of following traditional conventions and playing only a minor part in these illustrations, these market scenes dominate the biblical motifs so much that the latter are literally pushed into the background.In this painting Christ and the Adulteress, the biblical event takes place at the back, on the left, while the foreground is dominated by a market scene with peasants offering clay pots, baskets laden with fruit, vegetables such as onions, carrots, cucumbers and cabbages, as well as eggs, loaves of bread and large jugs of milk. It is this foreground which attracts our attention. There is also a peculiar mixture of time levels: the biblical scenario (with people wearing the clothes of antiquity) and the contemporary market scene (with sixteenth-century peasants) are intricately interwoven, as is shown in the Roman soldiers storming past the market stall. The same feature can be found in numerous other paintings of Aertsen.
./images/101.jpg	AERTSEN, Pieter	Cook in front of the Stove	Oil on wood	"Firmly positioned in front of the imposing chimney-piece, the cook stands surrounded by the food she is preparing to cook: voluminous cabbages in a basket, and fowls and a leg of meat skewered on a spit which she holds firmly in one hand, whilst with the other she grabs a skimming ladle. The sculptural silhouette with its powerful arms, its solid body and vigorously modelled face radiates a strong sense of assurance. The fact that she is looking towards the unseen part of the room suggests that something is going on there that the viewer is unable to see. Pieter Aertsen made use several times of this form of composition in which a single, solidly-built figure occupies the entire panel in a vertical format which accentuates his or her solidity. This is an invention by the artist, which although originating in the foregrounds of the works of Jan van Hemessen, has no real precedent in the Antwerp painting of the period.Even though he never painted a picture not containing a human figure, Pieter Aertsen played an essential role in the emergence of the still-life by granting a dominating place to objects and to victuals, which he represents in all their triviality. Whilst every element appears to have been observed with attention to real-life detail, the image has nonetheless been recomposed in the studio. What cook would place small fowls and a heavy leg of lamb on the same spit? We also find the same kitchen utensils, furniture and victuals, differently interlinked, in many of the artist's compositions. Whilst the household objects are drawn from life, the classical lines of the chimney are taken from the architectural treaty of the Italian Sebastiano Serlio, whom Aertsen would have known from the Antwerp edition of his works in 1549.The total absence of religious subject matter, which still underlay all genre scenes at the time, is another stroke of daring by the painter, even if 16th century viewers would have immediately recognised, in the cook, the Martha of the gospel narrative, who is busy preparing the meal whilst her sister Mary is listening to Christ's words. This image also has a moralising content and should be read as a warning against the dangers of the pleasures of the flesh, ""voluptas carnis""."
./images/103.jpg	AERTSEN, Pieter	The Egg Dance	Oil on panel	Interiors with merry companies or drunken brawls became very popular in the 17th century, and the work of Pieter Aertsen was seen as the first step on that path. This picture shows a merry company at an egg dance. The object was to keep dance while kicking the egg round in a circle without breaking it, then covering it with a bowl, again using only one feet.
./images/104.jpg	AERTSEN, Pieter	Market Scene	Oil on wood	Genre-painting, as an independent subject, originated in the Netherlands in the sixteenth century. Before then scenes from everyday life had often been depicted in the background of pictures with a primarily religious content, but it was only after about the middle of the sixteenth century that many painters began to feel their principal task was to represent everyday life for its own sake. With Pieter Bruegel the Elder, also called Peasant Bruegel, genre painting came to be generally accepted and found a great many adherents in the Netherlands. Pieter Aertsen, who was born in Amsterdam and worked mainly in his native city and in Antwerp, was one of the most eminent of these. Most of his works depict market vendors, scenes at fairs or kitchen interiors, with an abundance of carefully painted still-life motifs.In this painting he depicts an old Dutch peasant taking his produce to the market, on his head a heavy tub, in his right hand a brace of mallard and a basket of eggs. A peasant girl in the background kneels by a tray of pasties or loaves. The painter has achieved an effect of monumentality by using large spots of colour and clear outlines and by enclosing his powerfully modelled figures within the confines of a narrow space. Aertsen's great virtue lies in his sincerity and simplicity, particularly noticeable if we compare his work with later genre-scenes.
./images/106.jpg	AERTSEN, Pieter	Market Scene	Oil on oak	"This Market Scene - a painting in vertical format - shows a column of sea food on the left, building up and culminating in a ray and - directly opposite, on the right - a large number of fruits of the field and the garden. Wedged between this enormous abundance of produce, the farmer and his wife appear to be mere appendages whose job is only that  of proudly pointing with silent gestures to the victuals that are on offer.The ostentatious wealth of fruit and vegetables in the market scenes of Aertsen and Beuckelaer may lead to the false conclusion that the population had plenty to eat. But although more was being offered on the markets, this did not meet the demands of the urban population, who had to pay exorbitant prices for agricultural produce in comparison to what they actually earned. And so, the horn-of-plenty motif of these market pictures reflects far more the perception of those who benefited, that is, the newly-rich farmers. In this way the artist emphasized the commercial aesthetics of agricultural products from the farmers' fields and gardens, products that were meant to arouse in the viewer the desire to buy, though not in the sense of present-day advertising.However, this does not exclude the possibility of ambivalent reasoning behind such paintings. While stimulating people's cravings and appealing to their needs, they often contained a subtle element of criticism, particularly in Aertsen's biblically motivated pictures. This criticism concerned the contradiction between people's consumer habits and the demand of temperance (""fasting""). While this critical element was still obvious in Aertsen's paintings, it seems to have disappeared almost completely in Beuckelaer's.This painting has a multiple theme. The abundance of the market could be at the same time a representation of the Four Elements and an allegory of the Five Senses. Also the market woman is being pestered by a bird-catcher, who is gripping a duck round the neck with obvious erotic overtones - as well as a realistic representation. The painting is also a moral lesson, extolling moderation and restraint in contrast to the physical and sensual pleasured offered, for instance, in the plumpness of the fruit. In other paintings Aertsen introduced a religious scene in the background by way of admonition."
./images/108.jpg	AERTSEN, Pieter	Market Scene	Oil on oak	The painting is an Ecce Homo fragment. Similarly to other biblical paintings of Aertsen, the biblical event takes place at the back, while the foreground is dominated by a market scene.. Somewhere in the background, the picture - cut off at the top - affords a small glimpse of the platform where the masses are shouting 'Barabbas' (John 19:4-6). This is optically overlaid by the bow-shaped arrangement of carts and market stalls - a reversal of emphasis which is typical of Aertsen.
./images/109.jpg	AERTSEN, Pieter	Market Woman with Vegetable Stall	Oil on wood	The painting demonstrates a wide range of agricultural products, made possible by the improvements in production methods. Offering her fruits and vegetables, the woman is almost an appendage to her produce. Despite all exaggeration, the picture quite adequately shows the new economic prosperity of the time. At the same time, however, it still contains a background scene in genre style of embracing lovers in a stable, thus relating the painting to late medieval peasant satires. Peasants were regarded as lustful, sensuous and carnal by the middle classes.
./images/110.jpg	AERTSEN, Pieter	Butcher's Stall	Oil on panel	In the 16th and 17th centuries it was quite common for theologians to see a slaughtered animal as symbolizing the death of a believer. Allusions to the 'weak flesh' (cf. Matthew 16:41) may well have been associated with Aertsen's Butcher's Stall where - like on his fruit and vegetable stalls - a seemingly infinite abundance of meat has been spread out.In this picture, the viewer's senses are immediately assaulted by the profusion of life-size comestibles. Amid fowls, sausages, beef, pork, fish, butter, cheese and pretzel, the eye of a flayed ox's head disconcertingly seems to watch the viewer. Each object is a masterful still-life. Like Lucas van Leyden and some other Netherlandish artists, Aertsen inverted the traditional foreground-subject relationship; his narrative occurs in the background. Almost unnoticed at first, the stall permits glimpses of a tavern on the right and a landscape behind. The ground around the inn is covered with oyster and mussel shells, which in some context - as here - allude to their consumption as an aphrodisiac. Among the tavern's revellers is a prostitute with a possible customer.Meanwhile, groups of people, dressed in contemporary Netherlandish attire, walk through the countryside towards the church visible at the far left. Only the mother riding the donkey stops to give alms to the poor. She is the Virgin Mary. Led by Joseph, she and her son are journeying to Egypt, to escape Herod. This is a very different presentation than the standard flight into Egypt since no idols fall, no miracles occur, no angels or servants direct the way. Although beset by their own troubles, the Holy Family shares what they have with the less fortunate. No halos signal their divinity, rather, Aertsen accented their humanity to construct a moral about daily personal decisions. His pilgrimage of life offers a choice between a materialistic and morally questionable existence on the one hand and the spiritual path of the Holy Family on the other.Aertsen and Joachim Beuckelaer, his nephew and pupil, popularized peasant and market scenes such as this, which typically contain half-hidden moralizations and religious themes. Through their impetus in Antwerp and Amsterdam, where they painted, peasant and market scenes evolved into a separate artistic specialization around the mid-sixteenth century.
./images/111.jpg	AERTSEN, Pieter	Peasants by the Hearth	Oil on wood	Pieter Aertsen was a Dutch painter who had a workshop in Antwerp for several years. He painted altarpieces, but also peasant scenes with a moralizing undertone and kitchen still-lifes with religious themes in the background. He continued this work following his return to Amsterdam in around 1557, concentrating henceforth more on the latter genre. This painting may have been produced during his Amsterdam period.The subject of the work has long been debated, although we can be sure it is not simply a peasant scene. it was once believed to be a portrait of the artist's family, but that hypothesis was rejected some time ago. The scene has all the elements of a rural booze-up. Much drink is being consumed, sausages grilled and bacon fried. There are festive biscuits on the table and a tray of waffles. Crowns like the one worn by the boy were used on the Feast of Epiphany, but also during other winter festivities, including Shrove Tuesday. Neither holiday is being celebrated here, however. The bird-cage next to the door on the left tells us that the scene is taking place in a house of ill repute, such as a tavern or brothel. Other elements combine to suggest the latter - the way the young man places his arm around the girl's waist, the copious eating and drinking, the aggression symbolized by the man with the two weapons, and the foolishness reflected by the king's crown. Like many of Aertsen's paintings, this work has both a moralizing and admonitory content, revealed by the presence of three men of different ages, each symbolizing a generation, around one woman.There is some remarkable innovation in this painting. The figures in the foreground are shown full-length in the middle of the small space, which, together with the monumental format, testifies to the emancipation of non-religious themes in painting around this period.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 26 minutes):Johann Sebastian Bach: Cantata BWV 212 (Bauernkantate)
./images/112.jpg	AERTSEN, Pieter	Still-Life	Oil on wood	A remarkable feature of this painting is the the still-life and a biblical scene (here Christ with Mary and Martha) composed together. The effect of the compostion was strongly disturbed by cutting the lower part of the painting (about 9 cm was cut for unknown reasons).
./images/113.jpg	AERTSEN, Pieter	Triptych with the Adoration of the Magi (central panel)	Oil on panel	In the 1550s Pieter Aertsen produced several major altarpieces, however, little remains of them, since many were destroyed in the Iconoclasm of 1566. Two panels are in the Rijksmuseum which once belonged to the same triptych with the Adoration of the Magi: the larger being the central panel, the other the left wing. On the reverse side of the left wing the scene of Circumcision (or the Presentation in the Temple) can be seen.

./images/162.jpg	AKOTANTOS, Angelos	The Virgin Cardiotissa	Tempera and leaf on panel	"In the years that preceded the Turkish conquest of Constantinople and the ultimate fall of the Byzantine Empire, the Byzantine state had been restricted to the areas around Thrace and the Morea. The difficult circumstances and the insecurity that reigned led the artists of the Capital to seek safer places and new markets. Crete, an island which had been under Venetian domination since 1210, and which was flourishing economically, was one such place. Archival sources mention at least six painters from Constantinople who lived and worked at Chandax (the medieval name for the present-day city of Herakleion in Crete) at the beginning of the 15th century; among them were John Apokaukos and Nicholas Philanthropenos. The wave of ""artistic migration"" which went on even after the fall of Constantinople to the Turks (1453), led to the spread of the art of the Capital to the island and was a contributing factor in the creation of a particular school of painting, known as the ""Cretan School"", which was to dominate the art scene of the post-Byzantine years.Among the artists who lived and worked at Chandax during this period, worth mentioning is the painter Angelos. More than 15 icons found today on Crete, Naxos, Patmos, Zakynthos, and in museums and private collections, bear his signature - ""cheir Angelou"" (by the hand of Angelos) - or are attributed to him on the basis of their stylistic features. The great number of icons leads us to suppose that Angelos must have had an important workshop in Chandax. Additional information on the painter is provided by the Venetian archives. In them there is a will, dated 1436, signed by one Angelos Akotantos, who has been identified with the painter whose name appears on the icons."

./images/170.jpg	ALBANI, Francesco	Ceiling vault of piano nobile loggia	Fresco	The picture shows the painting on the ceiling vault of the piano nobile loggia in the Palazzo Verospi, painted by Francesco Albani. The depictions are: Phoebus-Apollo and Personifications of the Seasons in the centre panel; Genii of Morning and Evening Twilight in the ovals; The Planetary Gods; Genii of Morning and Night with their Children Sleep and Death in the spandrels.Since antiquity, colonnades and porticoes with painted decoration have been distinguishing features of the palaces of ruling houses. In the seventeenth century the main focus in the painting of a loggia, an indispensable feature of the piano nobile in palaces and villas in Rome and elsewhere, was the vault. The original pattern for the Roman loggia was theloggia of the Villa Farnesina,painted by Raphael with free-floating figures in the spandrels and caps of the vault. The piano nobile loggia in the Palazzo Verospi, painted by Albani follows this pattern, but borrowings from theceiling of the Galleria Farnese,fromReni's AuroraandGuercino's Auroraare also present.

./images/172.jpg	ALBANI, Francesco	Adonis Led by Cupids to Venus (detail)	Oil on canvas	Albani was a painter belonging to the Bologna school. He was influenced by Domenichino and Raphael, and worked in the workshop of Annibale Carracci in Rome.
./images/173.jpg	ALBANI, Francesco	The Annunciation	Oil on copper	Albani painted many versions of this subject. One of the best is the large altarpiece in the church of San Bartolomeo in Bologna, to which this painting is closely related.
./images/176.jpg	ALBANI, Francesco	The Holy Family	Oil on copper	The composition and figural types of this Holy Family or The Rest on the Flight into Egypt, especially the statuesque Madonna, owe much to Annibale Carracci, while the soft modeling and freshness of colour, emphasized by the luminosity of the copper support, is highly characteristic of Albani.
./images/177.jpg	ALBANI, Francesco	The Holy Family in a Landscape	Oil on copper	Small, highly finished cabinet pictures were a specialty of Albani's production and proved to be enormously popular with collectors, especially in France.  Many were painted on copper, a technique he had learned during his years working in the studio of Denys Calvaert, a Flemish artist who had settled in Bologna and operated a successful workshop.This devotional image of the Holy Family appears to have been particularly popular and it is known in a number of variations.
./images/178.jpg	ALBANI, Francesco	Holy Family	Oil on canvas	Albani is a typical representative of the reform movement introduced by Carracci. As a student of the Bolognese artists and a colleague of Annibale who collaborated on the decoration of the Aldobrandini lunettes, he had developed a degree of confidence in his choice and application of stylistic means that allowed him not only to handle large wall areas, but also to create small and intimate devotional pictures.In his Sacra Famiglia or Holy Family Albani finds that characteristic blend of sovereign grace and delicacy that today's spectator may find slightly disturbing. Those of us who regard such emotional emphasis and charm with some suspicion tend to forget the specific tasks and needs these pictures were intended to fulfil in order to satisfy a highly educated and cultivated group of buyers. The usual setting for pictures on this theme was a niche in the bedroom of a patrician house or palace intended for devotional purposes. This function also explains some of the typical traits of such a picture: the intimacy of a family gathering, framed by fragments of great architecture, the gestures of devotion of the two angels and the meditative attitude of the elderly Joseph - all signals with which the contemporary spectator would have been able to identify clearly.
./images/179.jpg	ALBANI, Francesco	Venus Attended by Nymphs and Cupids	Oil on canvas	Francesco Albani, a follower of the Carracci in Bologna, was famous and popular with his contemporaries for his graceful, if somewhat sentimental religious and mythological paintings.
./images/180.jpg	ALBANI, Francesco	The Toilet of Venus	Oil on canvas	This painting was probably painted as a pendant to Annibale Carracci's Landscape with Diana and Callisto (collection of the Duke of Sutherland, St Boswells). Carracci developed the composition of The Toilet of Venus several years after his Landscape with Diana and Callisto, and the greatest part of its execution was left to Albani, his pupil. ALbani later painted his own interpretations of Carracci's mythological inventions.
./images/181.jpg	ALBANI, Francesco	Toilet of Venus	Oil on canvas	In 1621, Ferdinando Gonzaga, the Duke of Mantua, commissioned a series of The Story of Venus for his Villa Favorita. Completed in 1633, these pictures are enlarged versions of the round compositions of a cycle formerly executed for the prince Borghese towards 1615-17. The Toilet of Venus belongs to the series.

./images/183.jpg	ALBANI, Francesco	The Phaethon Legend	Fresco	The picture shows the view of the Galleria, looking south. Between the doors the scene depicting the Sirens is visible.Vincenzo Giustiniani (1564-1637) was one of the most brilliant, and knowledgeable lovers of art in early seventeenth-century Rome. He assembled a renowned collection of roughly 1.800 works of classical sculpture and 600 paintings, among them eleven of Caravaggio's most important works. He purchased a villa at Bassano Romano in 1595 which was then thoroughly remodeled and enlarged. The artists who painted there between 1595 and 1604 all worked in the Mannerist style.The north wing of the enlarged palace was erected in 1607-09 and the painted decoration was accomplished in 1609-10. There are three rooms in the north wing, the Sala della FelicitÃ  Eterna (painted by Paolo Guidottiin 1610), the Sala di Diana (painted by Domenichinoin 1609) and the Galleria (painted by Francesco Albani and assistants in 1609-10).In the Galleria, Albani painted the legend of Phaethon, the youth who disrupted the path of the sun. The protagonists in Albani's wall pictures are seen reacting with violent gestures and upward gazes at the central event of the fall of Phaethon on the ceiling. The entire Phaethon legend, as related in Ovid's Metamorphoses, is illustrated on the ceiling and walls in episodes that are part dramatic, part lyrical. Albani designed the eight scenes on the walls as imaginary tapestries.Albani's cycle was highly praised through the whole of the eighteenth century. Later the Phaethon cycle and its painter came to be forgotten, and have only now rediscovered by art historian and appreciated anew.
./images/184.jpg	ALBANI, Francesco	The Phaethon Legend: Fall of Phaethon and Olympian Gods	Fresco	In the Galleria, Albani painted the legend of Phaethon, the youth who disrupted the path of the sun. The protagonists in Albani's wall pictures are seen reacting with violent gestures and upward gazes at the central event of the fall of Phaethon on the ceiling. By contrast, the assembly of gods in heaven is comparatively static - except for the figure of Phaethon plunging earthward upside-down. Apollo has raised an arm as a sign of his sadness, and Jupiter is flinging his thunderbolt. Mercury is pointing at the tumbling youth.

./images/192.jpg	ALBEREGNO, Jacobello	Polyptych of the Apocalypse	Tempera on panel	From the demolished church of San Giovanni Evangelista on Torcello, the polyptych portrays with exemplary clarity one of the visions described by St John in the Book of Revelations.
./images/193.jpg	ALBEREGNO, Jacobello	Polyptych of the Apocalypse (central panel)	Tempera on panel	The picture shows the central panel of the Polyptych of the Apocalypse. In the centre of the polyptych is God the Father in Glory with the Lamb, between the symbols of the four Evangelists.The ineffably expressive naturalness which makes the central panel of Alberegno's signed triptych so admirable appears again in the panels of the Polyptych with five episodes from the Apocalypse, originally placed in the church of St. John the Evangelist at Torcello. In the central panel for example, where St. John the Evangelist looks up from his writing to admire the Eternal in glory with the Lamb of God, surrounded by the symbols of the four Evangelists with wings covered with eyes, being worshipped by twenty-four venerable old men, here too the theme, though very complex, comes through with exemplary clarity because of the subtle expressiveness of the details which frees the sacred vision of every transcendent abstraction.
./images/194.jpg	ALBEREGNO, Jacobello	The Harvest of the World	Tempera on panel	Even more in the four minor panels of the Polyptych of the Apocalypse the transcendental significance of the gold background pales before the freshness and inventiveness of Jacobello Alberegno's imagination. As with the other scenes, so with the 'Harvest of the World', the text of the Book of the Apocalypse (XIII, vv. 17-18) is closely followed: 'And another angel came out of the temple... and he too had a sharpened sickle. And another angel came out from the altar... saying: wield your sharpened sickle and harvest the grapes of the world, for the fruit is now ripe'. The detailed and penetrating transcription of the sacred text into pictorial form seems to be softened by the enchanting addition of an arbour of black grapes with bunches of the fruit hanging heavy with juice and leaves which are already showing signs that Autumn is drawing to a close.
./images/195.jpg	ALBEREGNO, Jacobello	Triptych	Tempera on panel	Much more of an innovator than either Catarino or Lorenzo Veneziano was Jacobello Alberegno, who in the Triptych with Crucifixion and Saints, his only signed work, reveals himself to be an artist of penetrating refinement. If it is true that the two lateral saints, St Gregory and St Jerome, are examples of stylized Gothic figures, the images of the small central panel display a naturalness worthy of one of the best of Giotto's disciples. An extraordinary human dimension seems to govern the expression of sentiments in the picture: a grief-stricken St John the Evangelist clutches his cloak to his breast while the Virgin extends imploring arms and stares transfixed with anguish at her crucified son.
./images/196.jpg	ALBERTI, Antonio	St John fresco cycle	Fresco	The oratory at the west edge of the city centre of Urbino was erected c. 1393. Nothing is known about the commissioning of the paintings on the walls, acycle depicting scenes from the life of St John the Baptist.The unidentified patron was probably from Rome from where the Salimbeni brothers, Lorenzo and Jacopo, came to Urbino for this commission. Stylistic analysis tells us that another painter was also engaged for the wall frescoes in the oratory. Antonio Alberti was responsible for the scenes from the St John cycle on the left-hand wall and on the inner faÃ§ade.The picture shows the view of the left-hand (east) long wall of the oratory with fragments of the St John cycle in the upper register. The scenic compartments are considered to be the work of Antonio Alberti.The lower register of the east wall includes several votive pictures, separately framed but also painted on the wall, that must have been executed at roughly the same time as the cycle. The two votive paintings with an enthroned Madonna and saints were painted by the Salimbeni brothers.
./images/200.jpg	ALBERTI, Cherubino	The Cardinal Virtues	Fresco	The picture shows a detail of the frieze in the Sala Clementina. It was painted in collaboration with the Bolognese painter Baldassare Croce.
./images/201.jpg	ALBERTI, Giovanni	Ceiling decoration	Fresco	The Sala Clementina in the west wing of the Vatican Palace was painted between 1596 and 1602 by the quadratura painters Giovanni and Cherubino Alberti. In the centre of the illusionistic ceiling opening St Clement is depicted in glory, framed by a number of virtues and by huge cartouches with the papal coat of arms.
./images/220.jpg	ALBERTINELLI, Mariotto	Adoration of the Child with Angel	Panel	This is an early work of the artist. Featuring the Virgin adoring the Child with the help of an angel who hands him some of the instruments of the Passion, it is formally rather weak in its awkward spatial and figural relationships.
./images/221.jpg	ALBERTINELLI, Mariotto	Virgin and Child	Tempera on panel	The Virgin and Child are represented beside a window with a landscape beyond. The landscape shown through the window at right is painted with a remarkable looseness. The trees, some fine and long limbed, others made full with layered rows of browning leaves, are reminiscent of those in the background ofFra Bartolomeo's Noli Me Tangerein the Louvre. Albertinelli and Fra Bartolomeo set up a workshop in the 1490s. They appear to have been close friends and the two operated under an equal partnership.
./images/223.jpg	ALBERTINELLI, Mariotto	Visitation	Oil on wood	Mariotto Albertinelli, the pupil of Cosimo Rosselli, ran a workshop with Fra Bartolomeo, and like him shared an interest in the painting of Perugino, whose illuminating example is apparent in this work, unanimously considered to be his masterpiece. However, we cannot fail to notice also the monumentality of the figures and the geometrically divided landscape, influences, these, of Fra Bartolomeo. The spatial breadth is still characteristic of Perugino, but the narrative content is more vigorous.
./images/224.jpg	ALBERTINELLI, Mariotto	Annunciation	Oil on wood	The predella of the altarpiece with the Visitation shows three stories from the life of Christ: the Annunciation, the Birth of Christ and the Circumcision. Despite the small size of the three compartments, Albertinelli succeeds in constructing austere, essential spaces which display a great formal balance. The small, full figures are firmly and vigorously placed in scenes which respect the most rigorous perspective laws of the Florentine Quattrocento.

./images/227.jpg	ALBERTINELLI, Mariotto	Visitation	Oil on panel	This signed and dated painting is an autograph variant of Albertinelli' most celebrated work, the Visitation in the Uffizi, Florence, which is dated 1503 but not signed. Just five years after executing the Uffizi prototype, which shows the undeniable influence of Perugino in its use of soft highlights and its inclusion of a classical arcade, the artist returned to the subject using the same cartoon but introduced some fundamental differences to the design: the architectural niche and the landscape have been removed and two additional figures have been introduced. While the central figures may wear robes different in colour and detail from the prototype, they are very much faithful to the original in their harmonious pyramidal design which balances both movement and stasis. Interestingly, the face of Elizabeth in the present work is no longer in shadow as it is in the Uffizi version.The lateral figures may be the work of Giuliano Bugiardini, who is known to have rented quarters next to Albertinelli in 1503 and began assisting him shortly thereafter.

He painted murals in many cathedrals, and painted portraits of nuns. In 18th-century Mexico hundreds of portraits were produced on the occasion of taking vow of chastity of young girls going to a convent. This painting representing a 16 years old girl belongs to this series.

Among the pioneers of this style was Louis Alincbrot who painted the complex triptych depicting scenes from the life of Christ.The picture shows the central panel of the triptych which depicts Jesus Debating with the Doctors of the Church, The Road to Calvary, and in the background, The Crucifixion. The left panel depicts The Circumcision, while the on the right has a PietÃ , with the sarcophagus for Christ's burial in the background.
./images/284.jpg	ALLEGRAIN, Etienne	Landscape with the Finding of Moses	Oil on canvas	Allegrain followed Poussin by painting heroic landscapes.
./images/285.jpg	ALLEGRAIN, Etienne	River Landscape	Oil on canvas 	Allegrain was a follower of the two great classical landscape painters of 17th-century France: Claude Lorrain and Nicolas Poussin. During his early years he was influenced by Claude and like him, he evoked still ambiences and atmospherics bathed in a deep play of light and shade. But the strongest influence on Allegrain came from Poussin.
./images/286.jpg	ALLEGRAIN, Etienne	River Landscape	Oil on canvas 	In the last decades of the seventeenth century the ideal landscape of Claude Lorrain was continued by painters such as Ãtienne Allegrain and Pierre-Antoine Patel (Patel the Younger) who added to it a new type of artificiality which was almost eighteenth-century in character.
./images/287.jpg	ALLORI, Alessandro	View of the Salone	Fresco	The twenty-five-year old Ottaviano de' Medici, on behalf of Cardinal Giulio de' Medici and his cousin Pope Leo X, commissioned Andrea del Sarto, Franciabigio and Pontormo for decorations celebrating the pope's father, Lorenzo the Magnificent, and other family members inside the family's villa at Poggio a Caiano. The iconographical programme, designed by the historian Paolo Giovio, aimed to evoke the celebrations of the Medici house through a series of episodes drawn from Roman history.Work in the Salone was halted with the death of Leo X in December 1521. Pontormo was the only one to have finished his lunette fresco, frescoes by Franciabigio and Andrea del Sarto on the long walls were partially incomplete. The decoration was completed by Alessandro Allori in 1578-82, a commission of Grand Duke Francesco de' Medici.Allori first completed the existing parts of the frescoes by Franciabigio and Andrea del Sarto together with those he planned, then he painted two large scenes, The Banquet of Syphax on the long wall containing Franciabigio's The Return of Cicero to Rome, and Titus Quinctius Flamininus's Speech before the Achaeans on the long wall containing Andrea del Sarto's Triumph of Caesar. In both scenes Allori placed the events in a large columned hall that opens up onto a landscape.Finally, he painted the lunette on the wall opposite to Pontormo's lunette. It is a formal pendant to Pontormo's work, he took over the horizontal articulation, the number of figures, even the colours of their garments. The theme of the lunette is Hercules and Fortuna beneath the Tree of the Hesperides.The picture shows the long wall with Allori's The Banquet of Syphax and Franciabigio's The Return of Cicero to Rome, as well as the wall with Pontormo's lunette.
./images/288.jpg	ALLORI, Alessandro	View of the Salone	Fresco	Allori painted the lunette on the wall opposite to Pontormo's lunette in the Salone. It is a formal pendant to Pontormo's work, he took over the horizontal articulation, the number of figures, even the colours of their garments. The theme of the lunette is Hercules and Fortuna beneath the Tree of the Hesperides.The picture shows the wall containing Allori's lunette fresco.
./images/289.jpg	ALLORI, Alessandro	The Banquet of Syphax	Fresco	Allori's The Banquet of Syphax is located on the long wall of the Salone containing Franciabigio's The Return of Cicero to Rome. Allori placed the event in a large columned hall that opens up onto a landscape. He perhaps found his inspiration in Venetian painting, in particular, Paolo Veronese's depictions of banquets.Syphax was a king of the ancient Numidian tribe Masaesyli of western Numidia during the last quarter of the 3rd century BC. His story is told in Livy's Ab Urbe Condita (written c. 27-25 BC). In his twenty-eighth book Livy records that Scipio, coming from Carthage, was surprised to encounter Hasdrubal, who had retreated from Spain before the Romans, at the court of the Numidian prince Syphax. Their host was flattered that both combatants had sought his support. He invited Scipio and Hasdrubal to share a meal, where the scene that Allori depicted took place. The two bitter enemies  took their meal on the same triclinium.
./images/290.jpg	ALLORI, Alessandro	Titus Quinctius Flamininus's Speech before the Achaeans	Fresco	Allori's Titus Quinctius Flamininus's Speech before the Achaeans is located on the long wall containing Andrea del Sarto's Triumph of Caesar. Allori placed the event in a large columned hall that opens up onto a landscape.Titus Quinctius Flamininus (c. 229 BC-c. 174 BC) was a Roman politician and general instrumental in the Roman conquest of Greece. This historical scene shows us Titus Quinctius Flamininus, the victor at Cynoscephalae at a meeting with the Achaeans in Aigon in 192 BC, where he so convinced the Achaeans with his speech that they decided to consider the enemies of Rome as their own enemies as well and declare war against them. This is an analogy to Lorenzo de' Medici's appearance at the Congress of Cremona in February 1483, where he once again demonstrated his powers of persuasion on the stated fighting Venice in the Ferrarese War (1482â84).
./images/291.jpg	ALLORI, Alessandro	Lunette fresco (detail)	Fresco	Allori painted the lunette on the wall opposite to Pontormo's lunette in the Salone. It is a formal pendant to Pontormo's work, he took over the horizontal articulation, the number of figures, even the colours of their garments. The theme of the lunette is Hercules and Fortuna beneath the Tree of the Hesperides.This detail of the lunette fresco shows Fortuna as Victrix with the Insignia of the Tuscan Grand Dukes Triumphs over Envy and Fury.
./images/293.jpg	ALLORI, Alessandro	Allegory of Human Life	Oil on copper	This allegorical scene, the Dream of Human Life, is depicted on the back of the portrait of Bianca Cappello. The artist rendered this scene in an unnecessarily complicated fashion.
./images/294.jpg	ALLORI, Alessandro	Annunciation	Oil on canvas	The layout of the composition played on the beam of light directed behind the Virgin Mary and the vivid piece of still-life in the foreground are already features of seventeenth-century painting.
./images/295.jpg	ALLORI, Alessandro	The Body of Christ with Two Angels	Oil on copper	"In this painting the angels are dressing the dead Jesus. The subject is Byzantine in origin and rare in Western art. The mattress, covered with red velvet is a stylized variant of the ""red-stone"" relic, formerly in the Byzantine Pantokrator church. According to an apocryphal legend, Christ was lying on this stone when the angels anointed him and covered him with the shroud. The legendary event, shown on the small painting on copper, is supplemented with a liturgical reference: on the altar in the background, we can see a chalice, symbolizing the mystery of the Eucharist.Alessandro Allori works with definite contours, models like a sculptor and paints numerous small details.The painting is signed in the centre of the altar-step: ALESSANDRO BRONZINO ALLORI FACEVA."
./images/296.jpg	ALLORI, Alessandro	Allegory of the Christian Church	Oil on canvas	It is not easy matter to identify the beautiful, golden-haired Florentine woman wreathed with flowers like Flora or Spring as the Christian Church, or the boy with the languishing satiated look as Christ, betrothing himself to her and rejecting the Synagogue. In the interpretation of Allori, a late Mannerist, the pious subject acquired a strong character of courtly romance.
./images/297.jpg	ALLORI, Alessandro	Women on a Terrace	Fresco	Pure genre scenes like the view of women hanging clothes to dry or combing their hair in the vault of a loggetta in the Palazzo Pitti are extremely rare in the monumental form of fresco decorations in the sixteenth century. Comparable scenes are, however, regularly found as elements of landscapes or grotesques.This stunning room was originally an open loggia leading on to the Boboli Gardens, and located in the South wing of the Palace. It was designed to house the âApartments for Foreign Princes and Cardinalsâ (Guest Apartments). It boasts the oldest painted decoration in Pitti Palace, commissioned from Alessandro Allori by Ferdinand deâ Medici shortly before he became Grand Duke. In the centre of the vault, a trompe lâoeil depicts a terrace that opens out under the sky and, along the balustrade, various female figures as they perform everyday activities. The highly naturalistic elegance with which animals and some items â such as the candelabras filled with numberless species of flowers â are shown, together with the sheer quality of the execution make this ceiling one of the most extraordinary examples of Florentine Mannerist painting in a private setting. In the centre of the vault, a pair of angels are lifting the Cardinalâs coat-of-arms into the skies, surrounded by a wide variety of birds. Idealised landscapes decorate the walls in an easily narrative style, but also with a wealth of extremely modern naturalistic details, modelled on Flemish experiences, as translated in Florence by Paul Bril. The excellent quality of the frescoes means this work can certainly be attributed to Alessandro Allori, even if some sections are by workshop artists. Restoration work in the 1990s brought to light the illusory decorations that reproduce the balustrade on the outer side of the ancient loggia, as well as the brilliance of the original colours.
./images/298.jpg	ALLORI, Alessandro	Portrait of a Woman	Oil on copper	What strikes us in this portrait is the convincing compromise between the formal purity acquired from Bronzino, the predilection for enlarged forms drawn from Michelangelo, and the balanced, rhythmic spatial models of Raphael, for Allori was a truly skilled alchemist in combining these various influences in a dignified way.The lady portrayed is certainly Bianca Cappello, already painted by Allori in a fresco which now hangs in the Tribune of the Uffizi.On the back of the portrait is an allegorical scene, the Dream of Human Life.
./images/300.jpg	ALLORI, Alessandro	Portrait of Bianca Cappello, Second Wife of Francesco I de' Medici	Fresco	Grand Duke Francesco I de' Medici was a man of profound and obsessive passions. The Uffizi galleries, which he established, were one, Bianca Cappello (1548-1587), his mistress, and afterwards, the second wife, was the other.
./images/301.jpg	ALLORI, Alessandro	Portrait of Francesco I de' Medici	Oil on lead with gold leaf	Francesco I (1541-1587) was the son of Cosimo de' Medici and Eleonora di Toledo and ruled as second Grand Duke of Tuscany from 1574 until his death in 1587. The present small tondo was probably a gift from Francesco to his sister Lucrezia on the occasion of her marriage to the Ferrarese Duke Alfonso II d'Este in June 1588.
./images/302.jpg	ALLORI, Alessandro	Portrait of Tommaso de' Bardi	Oil on panel	The portrait represents Tommaso de' Bardi, a Florentine exile in Rome, half length, in a black doublet and hose with a statue of Fame.At nineteen Allori moved to Rome, where he was for two years, studying the ancient statues and the works of Michelangelo. At the same time he did many portraits among them that of Tommaso de' Bardi and of his wife Ortensia Montauti.
./images/303.jpg	ALLORI, Alessandro	Portrait of a Young Man	Oil on canvas transferred from wood	Formerly the painting was attributed to Agnolo Bronzino. The sitter was assumed to be either Grand Duke Cosimo Medici II (1590-1621) or Grand Duke Ferdinando Medici (1551-1609). These assumptions are, however, not proven.
./images/304.jpg	ALLORI, Alessandro	The Preaching of St John the Baptist	Oil on copper	In a nocturnal scene, John the Baptist preaches the coming of Christ. He holds the standard of the Resurrection above a lamb representing Christ's sacrifice. Allori seems to have looked back to the Mannerist for his palette, to Michelangelo for his figures, and to northern Europe for his landscape.
./images/305.jpg	ALLORI, Alessandro	St Peter Walking on the Water	Oil on copper	In this work, as often occurs in the painting of Allori, the composition is slightly over-emphatic. Saint Peter, kneeling in the foreground, enveloped in his billowing garments, seems in fact to be acting on a stage. The setting, instead, is made pleasant and gracious thanks to an almost archaic use of perspective, to that sea rising high on the horizon, ruffled by light foaming waves, and to the small boat, tossed by the waters, brimming with small figures.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 21 minutes):Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina: Missa Brevis (Tu es Petrus)
./images/306.jpg	ALLORI, Alessandro	Pearl Fishers	Oil on slate	The Studiolo is a tiny chamber in the Palazzo dei Priori (Palazzo Vecchio), accessible by a hidden spiral staircase. It was dedicated to the geological, mineralogical and alchemical interest of Francesco I de' Medici, son and successor of Cosimo I. Its walls are lined with two tiers of oil paintings on slate or panel that act as doors for cupboards containing Francesco's scientific books, specimens, and instruments.Alessandro Allori's contributions to the decoration of the Studiolo in the Palazzo Vecchio included the Pearl Fishers.Allori was the follower of Agnolo Bronzino, and his style imitates the cool, smooth manner of his teacher. Exquisite male and female nudes, human and mythological, play about on rocks, dive off boats, and bring up shells overflowing with seawater and pearls. Over and over the figures quote Michelangelo (the central nude seen from the back comes straight out of theBattle of Cascina), but only in the most playful way. The echoes of theDeluge on the Sistine Ceilingare transformed by Allori's predominantly pink and blue colouring.
./images/308.jpg	ALLORI, Alessandro	Fresco decoration (detail)	Fresco	The Vasari Corridor was built in 1564 by Giorgio Vasari in only five months at the time of the wedding between Francesco I de' Medici and Giovanna of Austria; it served to link up the Pitti Palace, where the Grand Duke resided, with the Uffizi (or offices) where he worked.It is a covered walk, almost a kilometre in length, an overhead passageway that starts out from the West Corridor of the Gallery, heads towards the Arno and then, raised up by huge arches, follows the river as far as the Ponte Vecchio, which it crosses by passing on top of the shops. On the other side of the Arno, the corridor passes through the interior of the church of Santa FelicitÃ , and finally reaches the Boboli gardens and the apartments in the Pitti Palace.This detail of the decoration of the corridor represents mixed beings (hybrids) frequently created in the Mannerist period by painters of grotesques. They are part of the decoration of the made by Alessandro Allori and his workshop.

./images/311.jpg	ALLORI, Cristofano	Judith with the Head of Holofernes	Oil on canvas	Judith with the Head of Holofernes has been described as the most celebrated of all Florentine seicento pictures. It exists in numerous versions, the best known being that in the Palazzo Pitti, Florence, painted for Grand Duke Cosimo II. The primacy of the version in the Royal Collection, however, depends principally on the vividness of the characterisation, the freshness of colouring, and the numerous changes effected during the course of painting even after several preparatory drawings had been made. Many of these changes are visible to the naked eye and accord with early descriptions of Allori's working methods. By contrast, the version in the Palazzo Pitti is slicker and more self-assured as a result of following an established design.The painting's reputation is derived from the autobiographical aspect of the treatment of the subject as recounted by Filippo Baldinucci (1625-96) in his Notizie de' professori del disegno da Cimabue in qua. Baldinucci records that Allori was essentially a libertine who was given to occasional bouts of piety. Regarding the subject of the present picture he states that the figure of Judith is a portrait of the painters lover, Maria di Giovanni Mazzafirri (died 1617), known as 'La Mazzafirra' that the features of the servant are those of La Mazzafirra's mother, and that the head of the decapitated Holofernes is a self-portrait of the artist. In essence, the composition commemorates an unhappy liaison and symbolises the suffering that Allori experienced at the hands of La Mazzafirra.The story of the Jewish heroine Judith, who saves her townspeople the Bethulians by cutting off the head of the Assyrian general Holofernes, is recorded in the Book of Judith found in The Apocrypha. The subject was frequently represented, sometimes as a straightforward narrative, sometimes with an allegorical (usually political) significance. The double meaning in the painting by Allori is confirmed by a poem by Giovanbattista Marino (La Galena, 1619), written in Paris where he saw one of the versions. Marino writes that Holofernes is killed twice, firstly by Cupid's darts and secondly by the sword. It is a theme that continues in literature certainly up to John Keats's La Belle Dame sans Merci. The female artists Lavinia Fontana and Artemisia Gentileschi depicted themselves as Judith, and there is an autobiographical element in the Judith by Jacopo Ligozzi of 1602 (Florence, Palazzo Pitti). Similar opportunities arose in the treatment of the subjects of David and Salome. Caravaggio, for instance, in the David and Goliath dating from 1605-06 (Rome, Galleria Borghese), used his own features for the head of Goliath. This last is a composition that Allori knew.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 17 minutes):Alessandro Scarlatti: La Giuditta, oratorio, Part I (excerpts)
./images/312.jpg	ALLORI, Cristofano	Judith with the Head of Holofernes	Oil on canvas	"Cristofano Allori trained in the school of his father and his grandfather, the leading Florentine Mannerist Agnolo Allori, known as Bronzino. Even if Cristofano may be regarded as an artist who broke with late Mannerist tendencies and went on to become an express proponent of early Baroque reform ideas, he nevertheless continues to borrow certain traits of ""Mannerist physiognomy"" in order to heighten the effect of a picture. In his most famous painting, Judith with the Head of Holofernes, the extreme contrast between the dark and bearded head of Holofernes and the angelic face of his murderess owes much to the Mannerist school in which he was trained.Allori is said to have created a portrait of his mistress Mazzafirra in the figure of Judith and her mother in the figure of the elderly servant woman. The head of Holofernes may be a self-portrait. If this is true, the picture would certainly be a classic example of the so-called ""portrait historiÃ©"" in which real figures are presented as figures from history. Whether or not this is true, the significance of this painting lies predominantly in the enormous erotic tension that emanates not only from the faces of Judith and Holofernes, but also from the sensuality with which the Old Testament heroine is portrayed. This major theme of triumph over tyranny had never before been presented from this point of view.This is the only painting from the long neglected Florentine school of the seventeenth century whose reputation has always remained at the highest level, and it therefore gained a sort of symbolic value. Moreover, its fame as a masterpiece of the Seicento spread beyond regional borders, thanks in part to its temporary confiscation and subsequent display in the MusÃ©e NapolÃ©on in Paris between 1799 and 1815. The work is by far the best of the many existing versions, copies, and derivations. Although it is not the prime version of this much-painted composition, it is possibly the only fully autograph surviving example.Allori, a Florentine, painted this canvas during Artemisia Gentileschi's stay in Florence, and surelyknew her version.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 17 minutes):Alessandro Scarlatti: La Giuditta, oratorio, Part I (excerpts)"
./images/313.jpg	ALLORI, Cristofano	Judith with the Head of Holofernes	Oil on canvas	The most famous painting by Florentine artist Cristofano Allori, carried out between 1610 and 1612, became an instant success and was widely copied, due in part to the popularity of the legend of the biblical heroine Judith which the artist interpreted autobiographically; the decapitated head of Holofernes is a self-portrait while his lover Mazzafirra is portrayed in the beautiful face of the young woman, whose extraordinarily luxurious clothing is a direct tribute to the city's thriving textile industry.This work by Cristofano acknowledges his influence from Caravaggio through the teachings of Artemisia Gentileschi who, in the same period in the service of the Medici family, painted two violent interpretations of Judith for Cosimo II. Cristofano emphasizes the heroine's beauty, the candour of her skin tones and the exquisite quality of her clothing, contrasted against the horror of the decapitated head she holds in her hand. Judith appears proud of her deed and sure of her divine protection.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 17 minutes):Alessandro Scarlatti: La Giuditta, oratorio, Part I (excerpts)

In many cases landscapes of the period not only showed the nature that surrounded the artists but also the population, both peasants and the upper classes, performing different activities. The snowy landscape, a typical Flemish genre, showed the people in their outdoor activities despite the cold. The scenes of skaters and carnivals became associated with this type of snowy landscapes.Denis van Alsloot, painter to the archducal court in Brussels, was a prominent landscape painter. The scene depicted in his Skating during Carnival takes place in Antwerp, identified by the walls built with Charles V and the Church of St. Jacques. What we see is a social scene where the characters perform different activities, highlighting the skaters with colourful carnival costumes. The clothing of most of the characters indicates that this is the entertainment of the upper classes. Many of the clothes that the characters wear come from Spanish fashion, but there are also some typical Flemish garments.

./images/330.jpg	ALTDORFER, Albrecht	Landscape with Satyr Family	Panel	A family of satyrs has settled on a tree-covered slope at the foot of a cliff. The man with horns and goat's feet is shown holding a club, while a blonde woman nestles against him and supports the child standing on her thigh. The couple seem to be oblivious of a scene taking place in a nearby meadow, where a woman in a red dress is attempting to flee from a naked man who is carrying a stick in one hand and holding her fast with the other.The uninhibited way of life of human or semi-human beings in the freedom of natural surroundings was a frequently occurring theme in literary and pictorial works of the Renaissance, following the precedent of antiquity. German artists became familiar with subjects of this kind mainly through copper-engravings by Andrea Mantegna and other northern Italian artists. By no means all these themes were derived straight from antiquity; frequently they were mythological fantasies inspired by Roman relief sculpture.The whole atmosphere of Altdorfer's idyllic scene suggests that it was inspired not so much by engravings as by the Arcadian landscapes of Venetian painters of the school of Giorgione; yet, although the motif of the naked woman seen from behind seems to confirm this, Altdorfer's approach to his art is fundamentally different. The satisfaction of depicting the nude, for which scenes from antiquity provided the most obvious pretext, is entirely subordinate in Altdorfer's paintings to his rendering of nature. The figures, which are fairly summarily treated, remain small and relatively inconspicuous against the dense wooded background. Whether the painter actually visited Venice is not certain but it does seem highly likely. About 1500 he was working in the Salzburg region at the Mondsee monastery, before he acquired burgher's rights in Regensburg in 1505. The present work, produced two years later, is one of Altdorfer's earliest signed and dated paintings. Like Cranach's Rest on the Flight, painted in 1504, it points the way to a new awareness of landscape in the Renaissance period, originally stemming from the so-called Danube school.Around the middle of the last century this portrait was in the Kraenner Collection in Regensburg; it later passed into the collection of Barthel Suermondt, which was purchased for the Berlin Gallery in 1874.

./images/332.jpg	ALTDORFER, Albrecht	Danubian Landscape	Parchment on wood	With a sentimental note and an intuitive science of light and colouring, the masters of the Danube school, Altdorfer and Huber, gave free rein to their lyricism in scintillating mythologies and religious scenes, in which the landscape acquires an importance never before equalled, and vibrates with a completely personal communion with nature.Altdorfer became a citizen of Regensburg in 1505, and later the Surveyor of the city's buildings. The steeply wooded stretch of the Danube below the city, with the castle of Worth, appears in several Altdorfer paintings.
./images/333.jpg	ALTDORFER, Albrecht	Susanna in the Bath and the Stoning of the Elders	Wood	Altdorfer placed biblical and historical scenes into German landscapes, and the figures were represented in contemporary dresses. As an exampÃ©e, this well-known biblical scene takes place in the garden of a Renaissance palace.
./images/334.jpg	ALTDORFER, Albrecht	The Battle of Alexander	Oil tempera on wood	This is the most famous painting of Altdorfer. Its subject is the victory of the young Alexander the Great in 333 B.C. over the Persian army of King Darius in the battle of Issos. The battle in fact took place in Turkey, however, on this painting it is shown in the rocky environment of the Alps with German cities in the background.The viewer, endowed with telescopic vision, witnesses the battle and the cosmic landscape. The ebb and flow of battle makes it difficult initially to distinguish the two sides. Altdorfer dressed the Macedonians like German knights and landsknechts (mercenary foot-soldiers), while the Persian warriors sport turbans and exotic attires. Hundreds of riders and foot-soldiers skirmish within sight of their battle standards. Darius' chariot, with mounted steel blades, cuts a path through the throng. Alexander, riding on Bucephalus, and some of his knights are in close pursuit. Darius escaped but at great cost: according to the tablet above, 100.000 Persian soldiers and 10.000 riders died. Although the actual toll was lower, Darius' army was decimated and his family was captured.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 12 minutes):Heinrich Ignaz Franz von Biber: The Battle, suite

The importance is given to these fragments by the fact that no wall other wall paintings survived from the masters of the Danube school (except a damaged fresco by Wolf Huber in Neuburg am Inn.
./images/338.jpg	ALTDORFER, Albrecht	Loth and his Daughters	Oil on limewood	Albrecht Altdorfer was one of the great German masters of the 16th century. Although remaining within the orbit of DÃ¼rer's influence, Altdorfer began a trend in painting which focused on the representation of nature, which he interpreted - in an almost Romantic style - as something living and moving. This development became known as the Danube school and Altdorfer was its principal representative.
./images/339.jpg	ALTDORFER, Albrecht	Diptych	Linden panel	The small diptych represents the Stigmatisation of St Francis (left panel) and the Penitence of St Jerome (right panel). In the diptych the two saints are seen close-up, in contrast with the infinite space of their landscape settings.Altdorfer belongs to a small group of German artists for whom landscape assumed great importance, both for helping to set the emotional tone of a narrative scene, and for its own sake.
./images/340.jpg	ALTDORFER, Albrecht	Saint George in the Forest	Parchment on lime panel	Altdorfer was one of Germany's most innovative artists in an era spanning late medieval piety, the Renaissance and the Reformation, and his work reveals many facets of a changing society. It is especially noteworthy for an expressive use of nature and for introducing landscape as a theme of its own in art. In this respect Altdorfer is the central figure of the Danube school.The forest was the outdoor setting most favoured by Altdorfer, and it sets the tone of many subjects both secular and religious.
./images/341.jpg	ALTDORFER, Albrecht	Rest on the Flight into Egypt	Oil on panel	The Virgin is shown resting in a throne-like chair by a richly ornate Renaissance fountain, while Joseph proffers a basket of cherries. Several angels are playing in and around the basin of the fountain, and the child Jesus tries to reach into the water. The fountain-pillar is lavishly decorated with sculpture. The significance of the group of figures at the top - a bearded man with a boy shooting an arrow - is not clear, but appears to relate to ancient mythology. Beyond the fountain the wooded shores of a lake stretch far into the distance. The rocks are crowded with gateways, fortified roads and towers, houses with pointed gables, ruins and decaying roofs - all so intricately interwoven with trees and foliage that it is difficult to detect the relationship of any one building to the other.The element of fantasy, which so dominates the landscape, is also apparent in the fountain, in which the figures seem to be drawn both from reality and from the artist's imagination. There is no prototype or parallel in Altdorfer's time for the bizarre appearance of the fountain. The painter's artistic invention was sin this case at least a generation ahead of his time.At the foot of the fountain is a stone tablet bearing the Latin inscription: 'Albertus Aldorfer pictor Ratisponensis in salutem animae hoc tibi munus diva maria sacravit corde fideli 1510 AA' ('Albrecht Altdorfer, painter from Regensburg, for the salvation of his soul dedicated this gift to thee, divine Mary, with a faithful heart');.this indicates a very personal confession on the part of the painter, his appeal to the Virgin Mary. The dedication must also be taken as an explanation of the central feature of the picture, the fountain, which - though symbolic of a heathen place - is nonetheless the water of life for the Holy Family. The motif recalls the legend, according to which a spring appeared from the earth when the Holy Family in its flight sought a place to rest. A few years earlier Cranach had treated the same theme;this fact establishes a singular bond between the two paintings.It is assumed that the landscape reproduces impressions from the country near Regensburg, and in particular the hamlets of Scheuchenberg, Lerchenhaube and WÃ¶rth, which are also recognizable in Altdorfer's Crucifixion in the gallery at Cassel. The painter settled in Regensburg in 1505 and twenty years later was appointed the city's master-builder. Most of his pictures point to a predilection for architecture and architectural dÃ©cor. An example of this is the highly imaginitive construction of the fountain and - on another panel in Berlin painted somewhat later - the ruin in the darkness which serves as the setting for the birth of Christ.

./images/343.jpg	ALTDORFER, Albrecht	Nativity	Linden panel	Staged as a nocturne, this Nativity takes place in a stable so ruinous that an additional miracle may be found in its not having collapsed upon the Holy Family sheltering within. The stable clearly enjoyed a loftier function before housing ox, ass, and homeless family, probably first built in Bethlehem as part of the palace of David, ancestor of the Virgin.

At the foot of the cross, where in other such works one finds the skull of Adam, said to have been buried at Golgotha and whose sins Christ atones for by his death, is their coat of arms, with a hexagram. On either side of Christ, who is represented not in an idealised manner but with the signs of his injuries, the landscape stretches away into the far distance.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 3 minutes):Guillaume Dufay: Hymn for Easter
./images/347.jpg	ALTDORFER, Albrecht	Christ on the Cross between Mary and St John (detail)	Limewood	The picture shows a detail of the landscape behind the cross. Altdorfer is considered to be one of the founders of the German landscape painting that emerges in the early 16th century, the great achievement of which is the representation of nature in its concrete reality, essential for the later development of art.
./images/348.jpg	ALTDORFER, Albrecht	Christ on the Cross	Wood	Apart from DÃ¼rer, Cranach and GrÃ¼newald, Altdorfer was the most significant German artist of the sixteenth century: a gifted painter, a graphic artist and the founder of the Danube School. He worked in Regensburg on the Danube, painting altarpieces and Biblical and historical scenes, and he was also the first landscape painter in the modern sense.The Crucifixion is a composition with numerous figures depicted against a golden background. This works illustrates very fully his fresh manner of representation and narration. Altdorfer painted several Crucifixions, but it is possible, on stylistic grounds, to date this version to around 1520. The symmetrical arrangement, with the cross in the centre of the composition, the crowd surging round it and the golden background (an unusual feature with Altdorfer) give the work a peculiarly archaic character. As in some of his engravings, the painter borrowed several of the figures and motifs from Mantegna.The painting was commissioned by Peter Maurer, Provost of Sankt Florian for his private chapel. It is signed with the artist's monogram at bottom right.

Mary Magdalen is seen from the back in a melancholic pose, as the other Marys leave with St John the Evangelist and a bearded elder just before the deposition takes place.
./images/355.jpg	ALTDORFER, Albrecht	Portrait of a Woman	Oil on panel	Very few portraits by Altdorfer are known. In this painting the image of the woman is a strange one, despite the apparent normality of the sitter, who has the air of a countrywoman. The cold light which illuminates her and the contrast with the background, with its sketchy and barely decipherable shadows, contribute to this mood.
./images/356.jpg	ALTDORFER, Albrecht	Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane	Oil on wood	One of Altdorfer's most ambitious commissions involved the execution of panels for the altarpiece in the Collegiate Church of Saint Florian near Linz, which was installed in 1518. Originally the ornate shrine must have resembled the greataltarpiece of Saint Wolfgangby Michael Pacher, with an elaborate framework intricately carved about painted panels, and inner sculptures, but only the paintings remain intact. Now dismantled, most parts are at either Sankt Florian or Vienna.When the wings are opened, eight episodes from the Passion of Christ appear in two registers; closed, four scenes in the life of Saint Sebastian are presented. The predella displays four more painted panels, including the Entombment and Resurrection, Saints Margaret and Barbara, and the donor, Provost Peter Maurer. Altdorfer's drama of the Passion is intensified in emotion and superbly composed with four scenes that takes place in the darkness and four opposing scenes on the right, which occur in daylight.The first of the series, Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane, is one of the finest examples of the artist's expression in themes of betrayal and violence. The threatening darkness of the night sky, striated by intense layers of red, does not conceal the nature of the sinister landscape of Gethsemane. In the foreground an eerie grotto of stalactites forms the uneasy stage for Christ and his three apostles, Peter, James, and John.
./images/357.jpg	ALTDORFER, Albrecht	The Arrest of Christ	Oil on wood	"One of the main concerns of the German artist Albrecht Altdorfer was to paint atmospheric landscapes. In the Arrest scene of the St Florian Altarpiece, which today survives only in fragments, the light from the torches throws up a night scene in a forest covered by a somberly glowing night sky.

They are not belong to the St Florian Altarpiece executed by Altdorfer for the abbey church in Sankt Florian near Linz, Austria. It is not known whether this altarpiece was also painted for the same church.Albrecht Altdorfer was a painter who tended to specialize in landscape and architecture to such an extent that these elements, from being simple background decorations, often became the central theme of his paintings. The dramatic and enchanted images that were the hallmark of his style caused him to be considered one of the precursors of Romanticism.Altdorfer's fantastic, visionary art represented the other side of sixteenth century culture. In his paintings he borrows the extremely vivid colours from dreams, the narration becomes impassioned, and the space-time elements narrow and expand irrationally.Particularly noteworthy is the crystalline clearness of the colours, especially the whites, which contribute to giving the story and the whole scene a somewhat unreal atmosphere.

Passers-be recovered his body which was watched over by an eagle until taken away for burial. He was said to have miraculously put out the flames of a burning building, or a whole city, with a single bucket of water. He is thus invoked against fire. He is a popular saint in Austria and Bavaria.

A good example of this is the Adoration of the Magi, in which one can clearly see how Altichiero has combined the Giottesque character of the figures with the penchant for narrative detail that is more in tune with the taste of his own time. He does this by directing the attention of the viewer to the retinue of people from the Orient, to the humble appearance of the stable, and to the clothing, with its often contemporary, ultrafashionable cut and high-quality materials. Furthermore, in order to denote the specific locality, the painter allows the walls and towers of Bethlehem to rise beyond the mountains.

./images/376.jpg	ALTICHIERO da Zevio	Crucifixion	Fresco	The Crucifixion scene is located on the altar wall. The grouping and the gestures of the figures are characterized by a particularly high level of sophistication. In the distinct contrast between the serene pose and inward-focused expression of the crucified Christ, on the one hand, and the agitation of the mourning angels on the other, we still feel the influence of theCrucifixion fresco in the Scrovegni Chapel,though the added thieves and crowd gathered below the crosses conform to the archetype of the densely populated paintings of Golgotha that in the meantime had become common in Trecento painting.
./images/377.jpg	ALTICHIERO da Zevio	Two scenes on the northeast wall	Fresco	Six of the seven paintings on the northeast wall (left to the entrance) are devoted to the life and martyrdom of St George. The picture shows St George Baptizes the King and His Family (top) and St George Liberated by Angels from Torture on the Wheel (bottom).According to the Golden Legend, the king had a large church erected in honour of the Virgin Mary and St George. The three-aisle basilica shown in cross section in the middle segment of the baptizing scene's expansive architectural backdrop, with its lofts, galleries, pulpits and all sorts of attached structures, is an allusion to this church.The St George cycle continues in the lower register of the wall with images depicting the saint being sentenced to various tortures. However, neither the cup of poison given to St George nor torture on the sword-studded wheel is capable of doing the condemned saint any harm. Two angels intervene and the wheel breaks into pieces, causing the commander, the torturers, and the onlookers to shrink back in horror.
./images/378.jpg	ALTICHIERO da Zevio	St George Slays the Dragon	Fresco	Six of the seven paintings on the northeast wall (left to the entrance) are devoted to the life and martyrdom of St George, beginning with St George Slays the Dragon in the upper register of the wall. It is characteristic of Altichiero that he did not limit the scene to the figures of the knight slaying the dragon with his lance and the princess; he added a rocky landscape that stretches deep into space at the left of the image and, as a counterpart to this on the right, included a fantastic image of the city of Silene from whose walls the king and his wife, as well as the inhabitants of the city, follow with frightened looks the battle taking place before the city gate.
./images/379.jpg	ALTICHIERO da Zevio	St George Baptizes the King and His Family (detail)	Fresco	In this scene, most of those present are wearing traditional garb of the period; moreover, several of these figures are presumed to be portraits of contemporaries. Similarities wwith theportrait of Petrarchin a contemporary codex, the man dressed in dark red behind St George can be identified as Petrarch, while the figure beside him on his left may be his secretary and pupil, Lombardo della Seta.
./images/380.jpg	ALTICHIERO da Zevio	The Beheading of St George	Fresco	This scene is located in the lower register of the northeast wall.St George was beheaded before the city gates. This scene is vividly depicted in the last fresco of the northeast wall. Soldiers with their upright spears and lances, officers on horses, and several citizens form a compact wall of people around the saint, who kneels on the ground deep in prayer. Above the saint's lowered head, the executioner raises his sword and is readying himself to deliver the deadly blow.Here Altichiero shows most  interestingly the influence of Giotto in the solidity of his groups of figures posed in large natural spaces. He achieves brilliant results with this technique, softened by Gothic details. In addition to this, the Veronese painter took pains to portray everyday feelings. Notice the way the father takes his son away from the scene of the macabre torture.
./images/381.jpg	ALTICHIERO da Zevio	Two scenes on the southwest wall	Fresco	On the southwest wall opposite the St George cycle are four scenes depicting the work and martyrdom of St Catherine (in the upper register) and that of St Lucy (in the lower register). The picture shows the scenes St Catherine Liberated by an Angel from the Torture on the Wheel (top) and The Martyrdom of St Lucy (bottom).The first two pictures, dedicated to St Catherine, are in very poor condition; they show the saint appearing before Emperor Maxentius to condemn idolatry and her dispute with the philosophers summoned by the emperor and their conversion. These scenes are followed by the picture of an angel intervening to prevent Catherine's torture on the wheel and the beheading of the saint. Both scenes have parallels in the St George cycle, here, however, an oriental milieu, seen in the physiognomies, head coverings, and scimitars, is emphasized still more.The first Lucy scene in the lower register shows the steadfastness of the saint before the judge Paschasius, the second and unsuccessful attempt to have her brought to a brothel with a team of oxen. These scenes are followed by the martyrdom of the saint, and the concluding scene is her burial. In the martyrdom scene she survives torture by flame and boiling oil, unscathed, and is then stabbed to death.

These scenes are followed by the martyrdom of the saint, and the concluding scene is her burial.In the scene of The Funeral of St Lucy the backdrop is a lavishly designed sacred building - the church that was erected over the tomb of the saint, according to the Golden Legend. Numerous citizens dressed in contemporary garb are present at the funeral ceremony, and some of their faced have unmistakably portrait-like features. This applies particularly to the figures in the left half of the image, among whom Giovanni de' Lupi, the brother of Bonifacio, and Giovanni Dondi, the famous doctor who was an intimate friend of Petrarch, are to be recognized.

./images/385.jpg	ALTICHIERO da Zevio	View of the Cappella di San Giacomo	Fresco	The frescoes in the Cappella di San Giacomo (Chapel of St James) were commissioned by Bonifacio Lupi di Soragno and his wife, Caterina dei Franceschi. The architecture, designed by the Venetian sculptor and architect Andriolo de' Santi was commissioned in 1372. This chapel was begun in 1372 in a privileged location inside the Basilica del Santo opposite the Cappella di Sant'Antonio (Chapel of St Anthony) and was completed, along with its painted decoration, in 1379.The painting school of Padua can be ranked as the most vigorous of the northern Italian schools: the painters of Padua built upon Giotto's achievements. The prolific Paduan fresco painters added striking naturalistic observations of their own in landscape, in the painting of animals, and in portraiture. The most successful painters of the period came to Padua from outside - Jacopo Avanzi from Bologna and Altichiero da Zevio from Verona. In the Chapel of St James, to Avanzi have been attributed most of the lunettes of the Life of St James, painted about 1374, while to Altichiero has been assigned the huge Crucifixion and some of the other lunettes.
./images/386.jpg	ALTICHIERO da Zevio	Crucifixion	Fresco	The Veronese painter Altichiero studied Giotto's frescoes in Padua and borrowing from them developed new forms of pictorial architecture. Around 1380, he and Jacopo Avanzo painted a cycle of frescoes in the Chapel of San Giacomo in the Santo (the church of Sant'Antonio) in Padua. The group compositions of his Crucifixion are those of Giotto's figures, but the architecture is structured so that it seems to recede ever deeper into the background of the picture. Only a stone's throw from the chapel, the young Titian was to work in the Scuola del Santo in 1511, where he was deeply impressed by Altichiero's colour scheme and composition.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 3 minutes):Guillaume Dufay: Hymn for Easter
./images/387.jpg	ALTICHIERO da Zevio	Crucifixion	Fresco	The Crucifixion above the altar extends across three of the five bays of the Chapel of San Giacomo, functioning as an enormous altarpiece. Although rich in anecdotal detail and portrait-like renderings, the fresco does not include the crosses of the two thieves who were crucified with Christ, concentrating instead on the central sacrifice. The cross is set in the foreground of a broadly coherent space which extends in greater and greater depth as it moves to either side, culminating in a hilltop castle on the far right and a firmly rendered and believably scaled pedestrian bridge, city gate, walls, and towers on the far left.
./images/389.jpg	ALTICHIERO da Zevio	Scenes from the Life of St James	Fresco	The Cappella di San Giacomo in the transept of the Basilica di Sant'Antonio was built by the Venetian sculptor and architect Andriolo de'Santi in 1372-76, and it was decorated by Altichiero da Zevio and his workshop.On the west wall above the choir stall, three consecutive scenes depict the Dream of King Ramirez, the Meeting of the Council, and the Battle of Clavijo.
./images/390.jpg	ALTICHIERO da Zevio	King Ramiro Summons the Crown Council	Fresco	In this picture Altichiero inserted portraits of the donor family, as well as portraits of Petrarch and his secretary and pupil Lombardo della Seta.
./images/391.jpg	ALTICHIERO da Zevio	Virgin Being Worshipped by Members of the Cavalli Family	Fresco	Before his stay in Padua, the Veronese painter Altichiero painted frescoes in Verona, including  the votive fresco of the Cavalli family in Sant'Anastasia.Partially ruined by the insertion of a canopied tomb in about 1390, the fresco is the collective votive offering of the Cavalli family from Verona. The men of the family, in armor, are before the Virgin. The family's patron saints accompany the faithful and their nonchalant movements contrast wonderfully with the stiff votive posture of the kneeling knights. The setting is also splendid, showing an imaginary fourteenth-century palace complete with galleries and pavilions.

He appears at once exotic and fully human, reflecting the age of exploration, during which this painting was made.
./images/393.jpg	ALTISSIMO, Cristofano dell'	Portrait of Christopher Columbus	Oil on canvas	Christopher Columbus (c. 1451-1506) was a navigator, colonizer and explorer whose voyages across the Atlantic Ocean led to general European awareness of the American continents in the Western Hemisphere. This portrait was painted half a century after his death. There are no certain contemporary images of the navigator, who was only one among many when he first set out in ships funded in part by Medici money.

./images/410.jpg	AMBERGER, Christoph	Portrait of MatthÃÂ¤us Schwarz	Oil on panel	Breaking away from the usually plain background of German portraits, Amberger here draws upon a compositional structure normally found in Netherlandish painting. He places the sitter in an interior, with a window through which we can see a stormy and mountainous landscape painted in soft blue tones, which become blurred as they recede into the background. The sitter is seated and looks out at the viewer, leaning on the edge of a table. The various objects around him refer to his profession. MatthÃ¤us Schwarz was accountant to the Fugger family, Germany's leading financiers, and was also the author of number of treatises on economics.
./images/411.jpg	AMBERGER, Christoph	Portrait of Felicitas Seiler	Wood	Amberger was a significant Swabian Renaissance portraitist working in Augsburg. He was probably the pupil of Hans Burgkmair and was influenced by Hans Holbein. He made well characterized portraits of scholars, citizens and princes.
./images/412.jpg	AMBERGER, Christoph	Portrait of a Young Man	Oil on wood	Until 1861 the painting was attributed to Hans Holbein the Younger. The picture, showing Venetian innfluences, is a masterpiece of the Renaissance painting in Augsburg. A companion-piece Portrait of a Young Woman is also in the Hermitage.

./images/418.jpg	AMERLING, Friedrich von	Emperor Franz I of Austria in his Coronation Robes	Oil on canvas	"Amerling was the favourite court painter and from 1830 one of the most popular artist in Vienna. His reputation was based on the life-size portrait of Emperor Franz in 1832. In this portrait the traditional Baroque attributes of a royal portrait are combined with a depiction of ""natural man"". This is what makes the portrait unconventional.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 11 minutes):Modest Mussorgsky: Boris Godunov, Coronation Scene"
./images/419.jpg	AMERLING, Friedrich von	Likeness of a Girl	Oil on canvas	From the early 1830s to approximately 1850 Amerling was Vienna's most celebrated portraitist. A likeness, almost identical to this portrait and entitled Modest Susanna, was executed in 1837.The portrait represents an example of one of Amerling's favourite compositional schemata to position the bare-backed sitter, turned away from the beholder. Effective highlights lend a soft gleam to the young face and betray the influence ofThomas Lawrence's art of portraiture.
./images/420.jpg	AMERLING, Friedrich von	Portrait of a Young Girl	Oil on panel	Amerling worked in a style that combined the elegance of British portraiture with the realism of the Viennese Biedermeier tradition. His sitters included not only members of the royal family but also the wealthy upper classes, prominent citizens and even fellow artists. He also produced a number of portrait studies such as this picture, which show just the sitter's head. These studies are notable for their spontaneity and immediacy.
./images/423.jpg	AMERLING, Friedrich von	Countess NÃÂ¡kÃÂ³	Oil on canvas	The Countess NÃ¡kÃ³, nÃ©e Berta GyertyÃ¡nffy (1820-82), the wife of a Transylvanian aristocrat who lived in Vienna and Pest alternatively, was an exceptional personality. While her contemporaries appeared timid and docile, she was a self-assured woman. She is seated at her desk in a dignified pose; the writing utensils indicate that her interest went beyond the narrow limits of family life. She learnt to paint from Amerling; she was an excellent pianist, as well as a composer of music. Her salon was frequented by musicians and painters, including Richard Wagner and Franz Liszt. Amerling did not disguise the countess's magnetic, matured womanliness. By including personal objects and the dog nuzzling to its mistress, in the grandiose composition, Amerling created a portrait which is near to genre painting.
./images/424.jpg	AMERLING, Friedrich von	Portrait of Princess Marie Franziska von Liechtenstein Aged Two	Oil on canvas	Friedrich Amerling painted several intimate portraits of the children of the Liechtenstein family.
./images/425.jpg	AMERLING, Friedrich von	Self-Portrait	Oil on canvas	In this unfinished self-portrait the artist depicted himself in profile from the left and with a serious and attentive look. He dispensed with any attributes of his art, such as brush or easel, and did not adopt an artificial pose, contenting himself with a clearly circumscribed partial view.

./images/427.jpg	AMICO FRIULANO DEL DOSSO	Portrait of a Gentleman with a Sword	Oil on canvas	This painting depicts a gentleman with a sword, three-quarter length, a landscape with a walled city beyond. Strong contrasts between light and dark define the painting: the beams of light from the leaden sky pick out certain parts of the landscape while other passages remain in penumbra. Nothing is known about the identity of the sitter; on the basis of the style of the costume, the portrait can be dated to 1515-20. The town in the background could possibly be Cividale, in Friuli.The portrait has borne many different attributions over the years, from Titian to Dosso to Lorenzo Lotto, while Federico Zeri classified it as a work by Girolamo Marchesi da Cotignola. The attribution to the Amico Friulano del Dosso is, however, by far the most convincing.

./images/430.jpg	AMIGONI, Jacopo	Juno Receiving the Head of Argos	Oil on canvas	Juno (Greek Hera) was the chief goddess of Olympus, both the sister and wife of Jupiter (Zeus). Her role in myth and are is principally that of the wife of a faithless husband, always plotting revenge on his many lovers. Her usual attribute is the peacock which was sacred to her in antiquity. In one of the affairs of Jupiter, the giant Argus of hundred eyes was set by Juno to watch over Io, the lover of Jupiter. When Argus was murdered by Mercury, in memory of Argus Juno took his eyes and set them in the tail of her peacock (Met. 1:721-4).Juno and Mercury, one of four mythologies painted by Amigoni for Moor Park, remains too little idealized, and faintly ludicrous. Imagination has been less exercised than industry; Amigoni's people are real enough to be commonplace - and to feel somewhat at ease when shown sitting on clouds. with Amigoni the rococo remains solid and earthbound.
./images/431.jpg	AMIGONI, Jacopo	Portrait of a Lady	Oil on canvas	The painting represents a lady, three-quarter length, wearing a blue and white velvet dress and seated in a sumptuous interior.
./images/432.jpg	AMIGONI, Jacopo	Jael and Sisera	Oil on canvas	This painting relates the story of Jael and Sisera in tones of delicate colours that contrast emphatically with the drama of the biblical event recounted. It was painted after the artist's return too Venice from travels that took him to most of Europe, when his palette became brighter and more refined.Sisera was a cruel Canaanite leader who ruled the Israelites for twenty years. Barak defeated his nine hundred charioteers by a surprise Israelite attack. Sisera escaped and sought refuge in the tent of Jael, wife of Heber the Kenite. She gave the terrified Canaanite sanctuary. When he fell asleep, she drove a tent peg into his brain. The act fulfilled the prediction of Debora, prophetess and Israelite leader, who foresaw that a woman would slay Sisera.
./images/433.jpg	AMIGONI, Jacopo	Venus and Adonis	Oil on canvas	Born in Naples but trained as an artist in Venice, Jacopo Amigoni soon began working in the Rococo style. Like Sebastiano Ricci and Pellegrino he often left Venice to work as one of Europe's foremost cosmopolitan artists, fixing the evanescent rather fragile delicacy of his style in great frescoes and paintings of historical subjects both profane and sacred. Charmingly Rococo in taste are the small canvases too, usually with some mythological or courtly subject. A typical example of this type is the painting of 'Venus and Adonis', executed with arcadian grace in the sharpness of the composition and the clarity and softness of the colours soaked in a jewelled and diaphanous luminosity.The story of Venus and Adonis, which has attracted not only artists but poets, including Shakespeare, tells that Adonis was the offspring of the incestuous union of King Cinyras of Paphos, in Cyprus, with his daughter Myrrha. His beauty was a byword. Venus conceived a helpless passion for him as a result of a chance graze she received from Cupid's arrow (Met. 10:524-559). One day while out hunting Adonis was slain by a wild boar, an accident Venus had always dreaded (Met. 10:708-739). Hearing his dying groans as she flew overhead in her chariot, she came down to aid him but was too late. In the place where the earth was stained with Adonis' blood, anemones sprouted. Artists usually depict two scenes, Amigoni painted both.The first scene is shown on this picture. Adonis, arrow (spear in other versions) in hand and hunting dog (or dogs) straining at the leash, is impatient to be off, while Venus imploringly tries to hold him back.

In the forest a grieving Venus is pouring the nectar that causes Adonis' blood to fertilize the earth. Cupid assists her. Venus' chariot stands nearby.
./images/436.jpg	AMIGONI, Jacopo	Venus and Adonis	Oil on canvas	Amigoni moved to London in 1729, where he remained for a decade, enjoying much success and significant patronage among the English aristocracy. During his stay in England, the artist provided large-scale mythological and historical scenes and decorative schemes for the country's many stately homes.
./images/438.jpg	AMIGONI, Jacopo	Venus and Adonis	Oil on canvas	Amigoni had spent his early career in Venice, but he left the city to make a name for himself as an international artist, quickly finding an avid audience in the various courts of Europe which had developed a taste for the charm of the Venetian Rococo. In 1730, Amigoni arrived in London fresh from a series of pictorial triumphs in Venice, Rome and at the court of the Elector of Bavaria, and soon had eager patrons amongst the English nobility and even royalty.The pair of canvases of mythological subjects, Venus and Adonis, and Bacchus and Ariadne, represent one of the most important works by Amigoni from his seminal English sojourn. These subjects represent two of the most recognizable and classic of all mythological stories, both with a rich history of pictorial representation in Venetian art. They are taken from Ovid's Metamorphoses, and in the case of Venus and Adonis, Amigoni returned to the subject throughout his career.

./images/478.jpg	ANCONA, Vito d'	Portrait of Gioacchino Rossini	Oil on canvas	D'Ancona moved to Paris in 1868, the year the composer of such famous operas like the Barber of Seville and Cinderella died. This posthumous portrait of Rossini, who spent several decades in the French capital where he was known for his sharp wit, appears to have been executed from a photograph, as its oval format may indicate. In the wave of renewed Italian nationalism, the painting may have been intended as a symbolic gesture to bring the Italian composer back to his native country.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 8 minutes):Gioacchino Rossini: L'Italiana in Algeri, overture

./images/480.jpg	ANDERSON, William	An English 3rd-Rate Ship of the Line in Three Positions	Oil on canvas	"The painting depicts an English 3rd-rate ship of the line (74 guns) in three positions off Table Mountain, Cape Town, South Africa, flying the Royal Nay ensign.The popularity and prestige of the large two-decker 74-gun Ships of the line (""74"") reached its peak during the French Revolutionary War when the British found that not only did they sail better than the stately three-decker but that by superior gunnery and training their two-deckers could be a match for any enemy warship, even three-deckers of over one hundred guns. Napoleon Bonaparte was sent to St Helena in the Northumberland 74 after he had surrendered to the captain of Bellerophon 74. For years the very words seventy-four were synonymous to the British public with an invincible naval supremacy."

./images/484.jpg	ANDREA DA FIRENZE	Bearing of the Cross, Crucifixion, Descent into Hell (north wall)	Fresco	The end wall (the north wall) of the chancel chapel is devoted entirely to three scenes from the Passion of Christ: the Bearing of the Cross at bottom left, the Crucifixion in the middle, and the Descent into Hell at bottom right. The Crucifixion extends over the entire width of the upper wall segment as a multifigure image of Golgotha. In this scene the crosses of the two thieves create recessional axes into space, although the actual space depicted is relatively shallow. The thieves twist convulsively on their crosses while a group of figures runs from an attacking soldier at the right.The Crucifixion image derives from Sienese examples such as Simone Martini's fresco in the lower church  of San Francesco, Assisi, and Lippo Memmi's fresco in the Collegiata, San Gimignano.The thematic continuation of the Passion scenes is found on the vault frescoes in the Resurrection, the Miracle of Pentecost, and the Ascension of Christ.

Since the 16th century it has usually been known as ""Ecclesia militans"" and ""Ecclesia triumphans."" More recently it has been described as the ""Via veritatis,"" the Church as the Path to Salvation. In addition to the idea of making the observer aware, via images, of the official church and its institutions as the true path to salvation, the intention was also to emphasize, among the institutions of the Church, the Dominican order and its work.The sequence of pictorial motifs begins in the lower left quarter of the image with the depiction of Ecclesia in the form of a large church building patterned after the Florence Cathedral. In front of the side wall of the Cathedral, we can see the hierarchic order of the medieval society: the Pope, at his left the Emperor and King, a prince, at his right the Dominican general and a bishop. Before them are the friars at the left and laymen at the right; then noblemen and knights, merchant, scholar, finally women and the lower ranks of the society. The basilica in the background is the symbol of the Church. The prevailing opinion in the literature is that Urban V is to be recognized in the figure of the pope and Charles IV in the figure of the emperor, Gil de Albornoz in the cardinal, Peter I of Cyprus in the king.

Beside this scene, allegorical figures can be seen. The most plausible explanation for these figures seated before a green hedge is that they represent the vain worldly pleasures and fancies.

./images/508.jpg	ANDREA DA FIRENZE	The Triumph of St Thomas Aquinas (west wall)	Fresco	While the main thematic emphasis on the east wall is on the pastoral and missionary work of the Dominicans, the fresco on the west wall - which is generally known as the Triumph of St Thomas Aquinas, even if this is not an accurate description - has as its fundamental theme the scientific and academic contributions of the order, exemplified in the person of Aquinas.The composition is strictly schematic and joins a wealth of personifications and historical exempla in a serial and symmetric arrangement. In the middle of the upper section, St Thomas Aquinas, seated on a throne and surrounded by an aureole, presents an open book to the viewer. Floating above the saint's throne are the four cardinal virtues and the three theological virtues, the topmost being Caritas. Seated to the left of Thomas, from the viewer's standpoint, are Job, David, Paul, Mark, and John the Evangelist; to the right, Solomon, Isaiah, Moses, Luke, and Matthew. Crouching at the feet of the saint, their bearing and gestures expressing resignation, are the heretics, Sabellius, AverroÃ«s, and Arius.In the lower register a uniform row of fourteen thrones extends like a line of choir stalls across the wall. Seated on the thrones on the right side are female personifications of the liberal arts, their antique and biblical representatives at their feet. The identification of the female figures on the left side is more difficult. According to Vasari they represent the seven theological sciences, but there are other assumptions, too.

The detail shows the right side thrones with female figures identified as the personifications of the liberal arts (from right to left: Grammar, Rhetoric, Logic, Music, Astronomy, Geometry, and Arithmetic). The antique and biblical representatives of the liberal arts (Priscian, Cicero, Aristotle, Tubalcain, Ptolemy, Euclid, and Pythagoras) are at their feet. Priscian was a Latin grammarian who lived in the 6th century AD. Cicero was a Roman lawyer, orator and statesman, 1st century BC. Aristotle was a Greek philosopher, 4th century BC, who invented formal logic. Tubalcain was a metalworker, mentioned in Genesis, identified with music possibly through a misunderstanding by Isidore of Seville. Ptolemy was a Greek astronomer, 2nd century AD, whose system prevailed until Copernicus. Euclid was a Greek mathematician, 3rd century BC; his textbook was used for 2000 years. Pythagoras was a Greek philosopher and mathematician, 6th century BC.In addition, the personifications of the seven planets are found in the tympana of the thrones.
./images/514.jpg	ANDREA DA FIRENZE	Scenes from the Life of St Peter Martyr (south wall, detail)	Fresco	On the entrance wall (south wall) seven scenes from the life of St Peter Martyr, another saint of the Dominican order, are located. The central section of the wall has largely been destroyed by the addition of a gallery installed during a subsequent period. The thematic accent of the scenes has primarily placed on the saint's posthumous miracles. For example, the fresco to the left of the entrance (shown here) depicts pilgrims pressing toward the tomb of the saint, seeking to be healed of their afflictions through prayer and touching his shrine.
./images/515.jpg	ANDREA DA FIRENZE	Vault frescoes	Fresco	On the vault, the thematic continuation of the Passion scenes is found in the Resurrection (north cell), the Miracle of Pentecost (west cell), and the Ascension of Christ (south cell), to which is added, as the fourth vault image (east cell), a free copy of the famous mosaic by Giotto known as the Navicella, from the Old St. Peter's.

The ten saints depicted were the titulars of altars in the Santa Maria Novella in the fourteenth century. Although thee painting mirrors the chapels of the church, there is nothing in the iconography to suggest that it was commissioned by any of the families who had patronage of the chapels.The represented saints are from left to right: Mark, Peter Martyr, Thomas Aquinas, Dominic, Luke.

./images/526.jpg	ANDREA DA FIRENZE	Crucifixion	Tempera on wood	"In the centre of the small panel, Christ hangs on the cross, which is marked ""I.N.R.I."" His head hangs onto his right shoulder and shows the marks from the crown of thorns, with blood oozing from his wounds. The figure of Christ on the cross is very similar to that in the fresco of theCrucifixion in the Spanish Chapelin S. Maria Novella in Florence, dated 1566â68 and also executed by Andrea da Firenze.Mary stands to the left of the cross, her hands joined in a mournful gesture, gazing at her son. The figure of Saint John the Evangelist at the right is depicted in a slightly more active posture of mourning than the motionless Virgin. He has his hands joined in front of his chest, and his look toward Christ expresses sorrow and disbelief. A Dominican friar kneels at the foot of the cross, embracing it, while his lips appear to be kissing the feet of Christ.Two angels are at either side of the cross; they also mourn. The left angel has covered his face with part of his garment, and the right angel is supporting his head with his hand. Angels that are able toexpress emotionsfirst appear in works by Giotto. Their depiction soon became very popular in trecento painting."

./images/534.jpg	ANDREA DEL CASTAGNO	St John the Baptist	Fresco	In 1442 Andrea went to Venice where he frescoed the ceiling of the chapel of St Tarasius in the church of San Zaccaria together with an artist known as Francesco da Faenza (probably Francesco Torelli). This is the painter's first signed and dated work, although earlier, presumably in 1440-41, he had already painted a Crucifixion with Saints for the monastery of Santa Maria degli Angeli, today in the hospital of Santa Maria Nuova. Both this painting and the San Zaccaria frescoes depicting God the Father, Saints and Evangelists, show what a strong influence the work of Masaccio and Donatello had on the young Andrea. And in particular, Andrea's interest in Donatello's sculptural and linear dynamic power already evident in the Santa Maria degli Angeli Crucifixion, becomes much more obvious in the ceiling frescoes in San Zaccaria. Clear-cut outlines define the Masaccesque sculptural figures, so that their forms are strengthened and hardened.
./images/535.jpg	ANDREA DEL CASTAGNO	God the Father	Fresco	During the first half of the fifteenth century, Florentine artists including Donatello, Paolo Uccello, and Andrea del Castagno traveled to other cities, bringing with them the new style that had been developed. In fact, Andrea del Castagno's earliest known work is represented by frescoes in Venice. They are rather harsh, direct, and uncompromising images that emphasize the more realistic current that is sometimes found in Donatello's sculpture. The picture shown is the seated God the Father holding a globe.
./images/536.jpg	ANDREA DEL CASTAGNO	St John the Evangelist	Fresco	The vault of the original choir (now transformed into the chapel named Capella di San Tarasio) of San Zaccaria, Venice, was painted when Castagno was about twenty-one, in 1442. The frescoes depicting God the Father, Saints and Evangelists are painted on narrow, sharply curved compartments between the ribs and consequently are particularly hard to photograph effectively. The style reflects a careful study by the young painter of Donatello's sculpture - especially the Zuccone and Jeremiah â with its broad treatment of sturdy figures with puffy draperies, its intensity of expression, and even such secondary details as putti. Features from Uccello may also be detected, but the most important pictorial force acting upon Castagno seems to have been the example of Domenico Veneziano, whose participation in the same fresco program has been suggested.
./images/537.jpg	ANDREA DEL CASTAGNO	St Mark	Fresco	In 1442 Andrea went to Venice where he frescoed the ceiling of the chapel of St Tarasius in the church of San Zaccaria together with an artist known as Francesco da Faenza (probably Francesco Torelli).

Clear-cut outlines define the Masaccesque sculptural figures, so that their forms are strengthened and hardened.
./images/542.jpg	ANDREA DEL CASTAGNO	Madonna and Child with Saints	Fresco	The painting depicts Madonna and Child enthroned with Sts Jerome and John the Baptist, two angels, and two children from the Pazzi family.The painting that Andrea frescoed in the chapel in the Castle of Trebbio (Pontassieve), belonging to the Pazzi family, is influenced by Domenico Veneziano's peaceful and luminous painting. Despite the strong naturalism of the two saints on either side of the Madonna, the scene is characterized by a gentleness of forms, a delicacy of colour harmonies, and a majestic composition that Andrea had most probably borrowed from Veneziano's Carnesecchi Tabernacle and his frescoes in Sant'Egidio.The polychrome marble tiles on the floor, the carpet covering the steps, and the glimpse of the two angels in flight show the expertise achieved by Andrea del Castagno in terms of perspective, while the statuary quality of the figures reflects the artist's attention to the sculptural work of Donatello. The ornamental motifs on the fabrics and floors almost dominate the figures and add a sumptuous richness to the composition, in line with its private destination.
./images/543.jpg	ANDREA DEL CASTAGNO	Last Supper and Stories of Christ's Passion	Fresco	"The influence of Domenico Veneziano's painting is strong in the decoration of the refectory of Sant'Apollonia which Andrea painted between June and October 1447. He solved the problem posed by the height of the refectory walls in Sant'Apollonia by using the old method of arranging the scenes in two rows, one above the other, but he gave them a visual unity: the Stories of Christ's Passion frescoed on the upper level are in fact conceived as taking place in a space behind the room where the Last Supper on the lower level is happening. The three scenes from the Passion (the Resurrection, Crucifixion and Entombment) are connected to each other by a group of flying angels all converging towards the figure of Christ in the centre, and by a common landscape background, which has been correctly judged ""the most powerful interpretation, of the Tuscan landscape in the entire history of painting"" (Berti).The scene that has been most highly praised, and which is probably the best preserved, is the Resurrection, originally the first to the left."

./images/548.jpg	ANDREA DEL CASTAGNO	Resurrection (detail)	Fresco	The scene that has been most highly praised, and which is probably the best preserved, is the Resurrection, originally the first to the left. Here, Christ rises up with the monumentality and the solidity of a statue, only slightly mellowed by his melancholy expression and the pale, soft daylight surrounding him. Below him, a group of soldiers lie sound asleep; only one of them has just woken up and observes the incredible event with his mouth open. His features are almost deformed by a blackish shading which makes the modelling hard and sharpedged.The obvious analogies between this fresco and thesame subjectpainted several years later by Piero della Francesca in Borgo San Sepolcro has been the object of many critical studies. The simplicity and the perfect perspective composition of the fresco in Sant'Apollonia is considered by some scholars an anticipation of the art of Piero, whereas others think that it is rather a reflection of it.
./images/549.jpg	ANDREA DEL CASTAGNO	Last Supper	Fresco	One of Andrea del Castagno's most famous works is the Last Supper he painted below the stories from Christ's Passion. Until quite recently the Last Supper appeared to be painted in much darker colours than the scenes directly above it; the fact had given rise to many animated debates between scholars concerning the dating of the fresco. But after the latest cleaning (1977-79) the colour and tonal contrast between the two levels has disappeared, and the colours of the Last Supper have been restored to their original beauty.All scholars agree in praising the sobre architectural structure of the room where the scene of the Last Supper is taking place: a room in the austere style of Alberti, with the lavish coloured marble panels functioning as a backdrop to the heavy and solemn scene of the banquet. Notice also the beauty of some of the minor details, such as the gold highlights in some of the characters' hair or the haloes depicted in perfect perspective. The other extraordinary element of this fresco is the remarkable balance of gestures and expressions, particularly in the group of figures in the centre of the composition, where the innocent sleep of St John to the left of Jesus is contrasted to the tense, rigid figure of Judas sitting opposite.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 8 minutes):Johann Sebastian Bach: St. Matthew Passion BWV 244 (excerpts)

The figures are arranged behind a long narrow table, with the exception of the Apostle at each end and Judas Iscariot isolated on the front side. The central group, composed of four figures, Judas, Christ, Peter, and John, is visually emphasized by a dramatically coloured red marble slab.

./images/560.jpg	ANDREA DEL CASTAGNO	Famous Persons Cycle (reconstruction)	Fresco	Andrea was commissioned the Legnaia Famous Persons cycle no later than June 1449, when Filippo Carducci, the owner of the villa and most probably the one who commissioned the frescoes, died. The frescoes were finished before the house was sold in October 1451.The Legnaia cycle consists of nine portrayals (three Florentine military commanders, three famous women and three Tuscan poets), placed inside painted niches made to look like monumental marble recesses, separated by pilasters. On one of the room's short walls, the figures of Adam and Eve were painted.The picture shows a digital reconstruction by Lew Minter of the Famous Men and Women fresco cycle originally in the loggia of the Villa Carducci, Legnaia. The width of the loggia is approximately 15,5 m. The figures from he left are: Eve, Madonna and Child (over the door, largely lost), Adam (largely lost), Pippo Spano, Farinata degli Uberti, NiccolÃ² Acciaioli, Cumaean Sibyl, Queen Esther, Queen Tomyris, Dante, Petrarch. The third Florentine literary figure in the cycle, Boccaccio, next to Petrarch, is not shown in this reconstruction. The nine figures from the long wall have been detached and exhibited in the Uffizi, while the frescoes representing Adam and Eve and the Virgin and Child on one end wall of the loggia remain in poor condition in the villa.

The masterful draughtsmanship and the perceptive description of the character, shown in a natural pose, confirm the opinion Vasari expressed of Andrea's work: ""He was extremely talented at portraying figures in solemn poses and in making them awesome, both men and women, with fierce expressions created thanks to his excellent draughtsmanship."""

The massacre had been plotted by the king's chief minister, Haman, and the date decided by casting lots (purim). Instead, Haman was hanged on the gallows he built for Mordecai; and on the day planned for their annihilation, the Jews destroyed their enemies.

The severity of her face, which is both beautiful and dignified, together with her raised right hand, is the sign of the gravity of her prophecies.A famous collection of sibylline prophecies, the Sibylline Books, was traditionally offered for sale to Tarquinius Superbus, the last of the seven kings of Rome, by the Cumaean sibyl. He refused to pay her price, so the sibyl burned six of the books before finally selling him the remaining three at the price she had originally asked for all nine. The books were thereafter kept in the temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill, to be consulted only in emergencies.
./images/569.jpg	ANDREA DEL CASTAGNO	Famous Persons: Queen Tomyris	Fresco transferred to wood	The picture shows one of the three famous women represented in the cycle.Tomyris was the queen of nomadic people of central Asia in ancient times. According to Herodotus (1:214), Cyrus the Great, the founder of the Persian empire, met his death in battle against her. Because of the circumstances, the episode came to be regarded as symbolic act of justice, and paintings of it were commissioned to hang in courts of law. Moreover, Medieval typology made Tomyris a prefiguration of the Virgin triumphing over the Satan.

./images/571.jpg	ANDREA DEL CASTAGNO	Famous Persons: Giovanni Boccaccio	Fresco transferred to wood	The picture shows one of the three Tuscan poets represented in the cycle.Giovanni Boccaccio (1313-1375), was an Italian poet and scholar, best remembered as the author of the earthy tales in the Decameron. With Petrarch he laid the foundations for the humanism of the Renaissance and raised vernacular literature to the level and status of the classics of antiquity.
./images/572.jpg	ANDREA DEL CASTAGNO	Famous Persons: Francesco Petrarca	Fresco transferred to wood	The picture shows one of the three Tuscan poets represented in the cycle.Francesco Petrarca  (1304-1374) (Petrarch) was an Italian scholar, poet, and Humanist whose poems addressed to Laura, an idealized beloved, contributed to the Renaissance flowering of lyric poetry. Petrarch's inquiring mind and love of classical authors led him to travel, visiting men of learning and searching monastic libraries for classical manuscripts. He was regarded as the greatest scholar of his age.
./images/573.jpg	ANDREA DEL CASTAGNO	Our Lady of the Assumption with Sts Miniato and Julian	Panel	"On 20 November 1449 the Rector of the church of San Miniato alle Torri asked Andrea to paint an altarpiece depicting Our Lady of the Assumption with Saints Miniato and Julian, today in Berlin. By April 1450 the altarpiece was finished and the artist began to receive his first payments.The Virgin is portrayed wrapped in a wide dark cloak, with hard-edged. lines, as she is carried up to heaven on a throne of reddish clouds supported by four flying angels whose carefully calculated poses and gestures offer us a further example of Andrea's ability at depicting angels ""in the air,"" a talent that Vasari praised at great length. The two monumental saints on either side of the Madonna also appear to be floating in a conventional and abstract space. The scene is dominated by the harmonies and contrast of the bright colours."
./images/574.jpg	ANDREA DEL CASTAGNO	Crucifixion	Panel	It is assumed that this small panel was a predella painting. In this painting, as in the Berlin Madonna, Andrea's attention appears to be concentrated on the monumentality of the figures, the brightness of the colours, whose brilliance replaces natural light.The painting is not accepted as autograph works by all scholars.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 22 minutes):Guillaume Dufay: Hymns
./images/575.jpg	ANDREA DEL CASTAGNO	The Youthful David	Tempera on leather on wood	"The unusual shape of this work is explained by its original use as a parade shield. Its painted scene is exceedingly rare -- most parade shields were decorated with simple coats of arms. This is, in fact, the only shield painted by a recognized master that has survived to the present day. It may have been carried in civic or religious processions or have been made as a sign of  authority for a citizen-governor.Images of young David, who overcame seemingly insurmountable odds to kill the giant, were popular in fifteenth-century Florence, the smallest major power in Italy. The city saw itself threatened by such Goliaths as the pope, the duke of Milan, the king of Naples, and the doge of Venice. David's image is especially appropriate decoration for a shield since, throughout the Psalms, David's poetry echoes the notion of God as his shield: ""His truth shall be thy shield and buckler"" (Ps. 91.4).Like many early Renaissance artists, Castagno has presented the action and its outcome simultaneously: David holds the loaded sling, but already the head of the slain Goliath lies at his feet. David's energetic pose, based perhaps on an ancient statue, creates a strong contour that would have been clear and ""legible"" as the shield was carried. Nevertheless, the youth's body is  well modeled, rounded with light and shadow to give a convincing likeness of a body in action.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 11 minutes):Johann Kuhnau: The Fight between David and Goliath (No. 1 of the 6 Stories from the Bible illustrated in music)"
./images/576.jpg	ANDREA DEL CASTAGNO	The Holy Trinity, St Jerome and Two Saints	Fresco	"Probably in 1453, Andrea moved to the church of Santissima Annunziata, where he painted two frescoes (St Julian and the Redeemer; The Holy Trinity, St Jerome and Two Saints) that are typical of his late style. No longer interested in the heroic and monumental characteristics illustrated in the Legnaia cycle, Andrea here imbues his figures with the crude truth that he had gradually mastered over a lifetime of hard work.A deeply realistic mood dominates the figure of St Jerome in the fresco in the Corboli Chapel in the Santissima Annunziata. The saint is portrayed as a fully convinced Renaissance ascetic, possessing both humanity and mysticism. In this painting we are immediately struck by a few details that are so realistic they are almost too crude, like the old saint's body with blood gushing out of the many wounds. Above, the Holy Trinity ""with a Crucifix in foreshortening; it is so well executed that Andrea deserves great praise for it, for he painted foreshortenings in a much better and more modern manner than any artist had done before him"" (Vasari)."

No longer interested in the heroic and monumental characteristics illustrated in the Legnaia cycle, Andrea here imbues his figures with the crude truth that he had gradually mastered over a lifetime of hard work.The St Julian in the Cagliani family chapel in Santissima Annunziata is damaged in its lower section. The figure of the saint is no longer the sophisticated gentleman we saw in the Berlin Madonna: he is simply a young man who is sincerely contrite for the harm he has caused. Above his hair, rendered with golden highlights, the metallic halo realistically reflects the saint's head. Above Julian, partly concealed by pinkish clouds, Christ imparts his blessing. On either side of the saint, in the midst of a lovely Tuscan landscape, Andrea has illustrated some episodes from his life.
./images/578.jpg	ANDREA DEL CASTAGNO	Interior view	Fresco	In the Greek Library in the Vatican, Andrea del Castagno was intent on painting illusionist architecture that would transform the room into a columned hall open on all sides.
./images/579.jpg	ANDREA DEL CASTAGNO	Crucifixion	Fresco	In the summer of 1455, the painter is back in Florence, where he executed another fresco in the church of Santissima Annunziata: a depiction of Lazarus together with Martha and Mary Magdalene, unfortunately destroyed. This fresco must also have been characterized by the same heightened realism visible in the other paintings in the church, and which we come across also in another work dating from this same period, the Crucifixion Andrea painted for the convent of Santa Maria degli Angeli, today in Sant'Apollonia.The composition is basically identical to the first Crucifixion that Andrea had painted several years earlier for this same convent, but the later work lays greater stress on realistic details. The Christ figure, for instance, is no longer the same dignified Masaccesque man he was in the first fresco: here he is shown with harsh features, almost more like a suffering peasant.
./images/581.jpg	ANDREA DEL CASTAGNO	Portrait of a Gentleman	Tempera on panel	Castagno showed an almost obsessive interest in naturalism in his portraits; the Portrait of a Gentleman in the National Gallery, Washington can today be safely attributed to him. The young man, portrayed in three-quarter profile and not in full profile as was the custom, is a typical Castagno figure, with his unmistakable strong sculpturalism.This picture is one of the landmarks of Italian portraiture: the earliest surviving painted portrait in three-quarter view, with the figure, splendidly dressed in the most costly red, seen against the sky, shown to the waist, with his right hand clutching the long end of a hood worn over the shoulder.

Annunziata comission, the Opera del Duomo commissioned the monument to the commander NiccolÃ² da Tolentino, which Andrea completed in March 1456. For this painting Castagno had to revert to the monumental and heroic model he had used in the Legnaia cycle. His description of the tense muscles of the horse and the general's furrowed face are very acute naturalistic observations that break the rigidity of that model.A comparison of Andrea's Tolentino with Paolo Uccello'sSir John Hawkwood,painted in the same cathedral several years earlier (1436), is inevitable. While Uccello froze the horse and its rider into a static composition of rigid geometric precision, Andrea expressed through the tension and movement of this fresco all the restlessness and vitality of his spirit.The Monument to NiccolÃ² da Tolentino in Florence Cathedral is the last work by Castagno that still survives; in 1457 he frescoed a Last Supper for the convent of Santa Maria degli Angeli, but it has not come down to us.

./images/584.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	The Annunciation	Oil on wood	Andrea painted this work for the convent of San Gallo which was subsequently destroyed in the siege of Florence (1529). The panel was then transported by the Augustinian Brothers to their new seat, San Jacopo tra i Fossi, whence in 1626 it passed into the possession of the Grand Duchess Maria Maddalena who transferred  it to the chapel then being built in Palazzo Pitti. It is an early work of Andrea done when Pontormo was in his workshop.The atmosphere is charged with ancient references quoted blithely in the theatrical background which forms a setting for the almost unrecognizable biblical story. It is usually interpreted as Susanna and the Elders - a Susanna who resembles a male nude; the Elders, three of them, lightly touched in with a few brushstrokes, are pointing to her up in an airy loggia worthy of Pontormo or Rosso. The two figures of the Madonna and the Angel in the foreground, accompanied by two angels, full of gentle human beauty, are vibrant with poetic intensity.
./images/585.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Punishment of the Gamblers	Fresco	"Andrea del Sarto's early work echoes of Leonardo, Raphael, and Fra Bartolomeo can be observed, but it is the naturalism of Andrea""'s teacher Piero di Cosimo - in whose shop he remained from about 1498 to 1508 - that is most evident in his frescoes of the life of St Philip Benizzi. There are located in the atrium of the Santissima Annunziata, near Baldovinetti's light-filled Nativity. Throughout the series, Andrea retained the sense of outdoor light and atmosphere seen in Baldovinetti's fresco; this was suggested by the site itself, which was filled with sunlight. The fantastic landscape masses, jutting rocks, and trees in the scene in which the saint punishes gamblers derive from Piero di Cosimo."
./images/586.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Journey of the Magi	Fresco	Andrea del Sarto's impressively fluent and richly lyrical style is manifested first in his series of five mural paintings depicting scenes from the story of the spiritual founder of the Servite Order, Filippo Benizzi. They were created for the atrium of the important pilgrimage church of Santissima Annunziata in Florence from 1509 onwards. They were followed by two more frescoes with biblical subjects on the opposite side of the space, the last of which, the Birth of the Virgin is dated 1514.The Journey of the Magi represents an almost unprecedented subject showing the three Magi arriving in train at Herod's palace displaying portraits of contemporaries.
./images/587.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Miraculous Cure by Relics of Filippo Benizzi	Fresco	In the atrium of Santissima Annunziata, the Servite church in Florence, lunette frescoes on the left side of the courtyard portray the life of the patron saint of the order, Filippo Benizzi. One episode from his life had already been frescoed by Cosimo Rosselli in the fifteenth century. Andrea del Sarto turned it into a series with five more scenes in 1509-10. The last painting on the entrance side shows a miraculous cure by Filippo Benizzi's relics. A priest in an apse is showing the holy objects, and the people are approaching from the front and sides. The motifs of an arch and columns harmonize with the real architecture of the atrium.
./images/588.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	View of the Atrium	Frescoes	This view of the atrium in Santissima Annunziata in Florence shows the frescoes from left to right, St Philip Benizzi Curing the Leper by Andreas del Sarto (1509-10), The Vocation of St Philip Benizzi by Cosimo Rosselli (c. 1475), and the Nativity by Baldovinetti (1460-62).
./images/589.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Birth of the Virgin	Fresco	The interior is vast and elaborate, dominated by the huge canopy of the bed of the woman in labour, and defined in all its vastness by elegant architectural features and furnishings. In this grandiose framework, which presupposes Andrea's clear knowledge of what Raphael and Michelangelo had been working in Rome, the women are moving slowly attending with serene solicitude to the tasks as laid down by the account  in the apocryphal Gospels, leading the scene an absolutely original kind of animation.
./images/590.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Baptism of the People	Fresco	In Andrea's hands, the use of monochromatic pigments in this fresco creates an almost silvery aura. The subject of the Baptism of the People offered a challenge appropriate to a painter of his generation and of his innate skills. The emphasis is upon the rendering of the figure and in particular the nude in a variety of poses and states of undress, consistent with the subject matter.
./images/592.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	The Sermon of John the Baptist	Fresco	For the Florentine Compagnia dello Scalzo, Andrea del Sarto frescoed the atrium of the brotherhood's chapel. The artist worked on it from 1509 to 1526, with interruptions. A frieze depicts the life of John the Baptist, the patron saint of the brotherhood. Sarto executed the entire decoration in grisaille. This did not just save the brotherhood money, the renunciation of colour also express the rigor and humility of its communal ideal.
./images/593.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Charity	Oil on canvas (transferred)	Like Leonardo, Andrea del Sarto was called to France, where he produced a painting in harmony with his compatriot's pictorial ideals. The personification of Charity holds two children while another, slightly older, is asleep at her feet. In the lower left corner is a trompe l'oeil scrap of paper bearing the date and the artist's name. The entire scene is located in an idealized landscape.
./images/594.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Madonna of the Harpies	Oil on wood	"Giorgio Vasari, who frequented Andrea del Sarto's studio as a young man, defined him as ""the flawless painter"". His style, shaped by his studies of the works of Michelangelo and Raphael, and characterised by an exquisitely balanced composition and high level of formal control, strongly influenced 16th Florentine painting, to such an extent that it was considered a precursor of Mannerism.Andrea del Sarto was commissioned to execute the Virgin and Child between Sts Francis of Assisi and John the Evangelist (called the Madonna of the Harpies) for the nuns of the convent of St Francis de'Macci. Within its solid and meticulous compositional structure, the artist almost seamlessly combines the typical pyramidal shape of the Virgins painted by Raphael with the statuesque feel of the figures created by Michelangelo, mellowing them with the delicate, shaded colours of Leonardo da Vinci.The traditional title of the painting was coined based on Vasari's identification of the monsters depicted on the Virgin's pedestal as harpies. However, based on an iconographic interpretation of the work, which assigns an eschatological symbolism to the subject, today critics mostly agree that they depict the locusts described in St John the Evangelist's Apocalypse."
./images/595.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Madonna of the Harpies	Oil on wood	"Perhaps the most famous work of Andrea del Sarto is the altarpiece painted for the nuns of San Francesco dei Macci, known as the Madonna of the Harpies.According to the contract signed on May 14, 1515 the picture was to depict the Madonna and Child crowned by two angels and flanked by St John the Evangelist and St Bonaventure, and to be delivered within a year. But in fact the work is dated 1517, and shows St John the Evangelist and St Francis on either side of the Madonna and Child on a high polygonal pedestal. The latter is decorated at the corners with monster-like figures (the so-called Harpies), while in the centre, beneath the artist's signature, are the opening words of a hymn to Our Lady of the Assumption. We therefore have not the Coronation of the Virgin but the Virgin of the Assumption.These variations on the original commission, and the subject itself, which is not a traditional Madonna and Child Enthroned between Two Saints, but a highly unusual presentation of the Virgin, full-figure on that enigmatic pedestal with the images of the ""harpies,"" have led to a lot of thought and attempted explanations on the part of all critics. The most recent interpretation is that it is a depiction, based on the text of the Book of Revelations, of the Virgin triumphant over evil, symbolized by the monstrous figures, the ""harpies,"" which are in fact the ""locusts"" mentioned in Revelations; and besides that, bears witness to the cult of the Virgin by the clients, the conventual Franciscans.Having removed the layers of dirt and overpainting, the 1984 restoration has re-established the exceptionally rich colouring of the work, praised by Vasari as being ""of singular and truly rare beauty."" The figure of the Madonna, wrought into a composed chiasmus in order to balance the weight of the Child (who on the other hand is lively, smiling, and as ambiguous as Rosso's putti), lights up the centre of the picture with the intense rose-colour of her robe tempered by harmony with the pale blue of her mantle, and with the brilliant yellow of the light fabric draped over her shoulders beneath the beautiful drapery of the white veil covering her head. On her left is the sculptural St John (painted from a terracotta model by Sansovino) swathed in a cinnabar red mantle linked to the lilac of his robe by means of a highly refined drapery, while on the other side the figure of St Francis strikes a clear note that emerges by subtle varieties of tone from the architectural motif of the background; while in the background one can once more see ""the smoke of transparent clouds veiling the architecture and the figures, that appear to move"" (Vasari): a warm, mysterious halo, made of colours and of shadows, that behind and around the figures impels an atmosphere that implies the rich spiritual message brought to us by this painting.The Madonna of the Harpies is truly a milestone in the career of Andrea del Sarto, and bears witness to the level of maturity of the most significant artistic experiences of the early 16th century: the ""atmospheric"" painting of Leonardo, the meditation recently infused with a new freshness in the ""grandiose"" manner of Michelangelo, the elegant and solemn classicism of Fra Bartolomeo endowed with a new intensity of colour after his stay in Venice, the experience of Raphael's work in Rome (and in this case the Sistine Madonna is usually mentioned); these are all motifs that come together in a single stylistic solution, the greatness of which was immediately recognized in Florence and elsewhere. This general admiration was shared almost two centuries later by Prince Ferdinando de' Medici, who acquired the picture for his collection in Palazzo Pitti, offering the nuns in exchange for it not only a copy of the picture done by Francesco Petrucci, but also the embellishment, and practically the remodeling and restoration of all the decoration of their church by Foggini."
./images/596.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Madonna of the Harpies (detail)	Oil on wood	"The figure of the Madonna, wrought into a composed chiasmus in order to balance the weight of the Child, lights up the centre of the picture with the intense rose-colour of her robe tempered by harmony with the pale blue of her mantle, and with the brilliant yellow of the light fabric draped over her shoulders beneath the beautiful drapery of the white veil covering her head.For centuries - ever since a jjudgment by Vasari - the work was considered to be the prototype of classicism instilled into religious subjects, a refined synthesis of Leonardesque `sfumato', Raphaelesque balance, and plastic monumentality in the style of Michelangelo. Andrea del Sarto, who Vasari dubbed the ""painter without errors"", gives here a typical example of intellectual religiousness of clear neo-Platonic derivation."

./images/598.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Madonna and Child with St Elisabeth, the Infant St John, and Two Angels	Oil on wood	According to Vasari, this painting is one of the two Madonnas painted by Andrea del Sarto for FranÃ§ois I around 1516. The subject is the visit of St Elisabeth and the Infant St John at the Virgin and her Child.
./images/599.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Madonna and Child with the Young St John	Oil on wood	One is struck by the extraordinary originality of this composition, constructed on an X-shaped scheme which may be discerned beneath the violent emotional expressiveness of the three protagonists. The Madonna's sweet face is shadowed by the soft chiaroscuro that also gives depth and body to the colours. She is seated on the ground, like the traditional madonna of Humility, filling the space diagonally. In a dramatically unstable pose between her knees, a Child Jesus with an elongated body transforms the jocular movements of a putto into a tragic contortion of the limbs and of the smile, in the awareness of his destiny which is matched by a range of colours unusually cold for Andrea, based on subtle relations between grey and violet.Andrea del Sarto painted this large Madonna for the Florentine businessman Giovanni Gaddi.
./images/600.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Madonna and Child with Sts Catherine, Elizabeth and John the Baptist	Oil on canvas transferred from wood	One of the typical works of the artist's mature period, it was painted as an altarpiece. Saint Catherine is the portrait of Lucrezia, the wife of the artist.
./images/601.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Portrait of a Lady with a Book	Oil on wood	The young woman, shown in three-quarter view, is seated with her right arm on the back of the chair, while gazing out at the onlooker with a hint of an inviting smile. The dark background serves to highlight the wide-sleeved blue dress and white shirt, decorated with a floral pendant. She is holding a 'petrarchino', a printed copy of the Canzoniere by Francesco Petrarca, a very popular type of book in the 16th century, due to the small size that made it suitable for the private enjoyment of reading.We do not know the name of the woman. In this intense portrait, with its rich palette of blues, Andrea draws on the closest examples of portraiture, not only Florentine, from Raphael to the Venetians, such as Sebastiano del Piombo, or Lotto, from whom he takes the freer, more intimate style of interpretation.
./images/602.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Portrait of a Woman with a Basket of Spindles	Oil on wood	Great dignity and extreme tenderness can be seen in this superb portrait of Woman with a Basket of Spindles. For a long time it was thought to be by Pontormo and only recently attributed to Andrea del Sarto. This is possibly one of the paintings that Andrea del Sarto began and his assistant Jacopo Pontormo finished. Typical of Andrea, in fact, are the slightly rotating planes, aimed at defining a compact mass in movement, totally remote from the harsh, almost neo-Gothic line which distinguishes the portrait-painting of Pontormo. The heavy use of chiaroscuro takes nothing away from the chromatic richness of the clothes whose soft drapery confers to the woman a classic monumentality.
./images/603.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Portrait of Baccio Bandinelli	Oil on canvas	Laboratory examinations performed during the last restoration in 1986 have shown that this picture is a copy, albeit a very old and good one, of the portrait mentioned by Vasari in the first edition of his artists' biographies. It was executed in the late sixteenth-early seventeenth century, before 1635.
./images/604.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Christ the Redeemer	Wood	At the SS. Annunziata is the door of the tabernacle representing Christ the Redeemer, which is still in its original place, on the altar of the first chapel on the left.
./images/605.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Tobias and the Angel with St Leonard and Donor	Panel	This medium-sized altarpiece on panel was painted for the church of Sta Lucia a Settimello, outside Florence, for the family altar of Leonardo Morelli.Tobias holds the hand of the Archangel Raphael at the right with the donor, richly dressed in a red cloak with fur trim, and his namesaint Leonard at the left. Tobias's little dog looks out at the viewer and wags his tail to add a sense of delightful immediacy to the work. St Leonard holds his attribute of prison fetters on top of a book rested on the arm of Tobias. The four youthful figures are set before an empty landscape and a uniform blue sky surmounted by a small, blessing Christ in Glory holding a Cross. Rather than the overall design, the innovative and vibrant aspects of the work are the treatment of colour and atmosphere.
./images/606.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Portrait of a Young Man	Oil on canvas	The subject of this famous portrait - formerly thought to be a self-portrait - is an unknown young man looking up from his book.Daylight enters as if through a high and narrow window on our left. Brilliant on the gathered shirt, reflections from which define the curve of the jaw and the twist of the neck, it casts deep shadows on the eye sockets, smoulders in the dark eyes, shapes the skull under the triangular hat, lends mobility and colour to the distinctive features. The twisting pose is at once momentary and stable.
./images/607.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Triumph of Caesar	Fresco	"The twenty-five-year old Ottaviano de' Medici, on behalf of Cardinal Giulio de' Medici and his cousin Pope Leo X, commissioned Andrea del Sarto, Franciabigio and Pontormo for decorations celebrating the pope's father, Lorenzo the Magnificent, and other family members inside the family's villa at Poggio a Caiano. The iconographical programme, designed by the historian Paolo Giovio, aimed to evoke the celebrations of the Medici house through a series of episodes drawn from Roman history.Work in the Salone was halted with the death of Leo X in December 1521. Pontormo was the only one to have finished his lunette fresco, frescoes by Franciabigio and Andrea del Sarto on the long walls were partially incomplete. The decoration was completed by Alessandro Allori in 1578-82, a commission of Grand Duke Francesco de' Medici.The Triumph of Caesar is located on one of the long walls of the Salone. It presents an interlocking of Roman and Medicean history such as the return of Cosimo de' Medici from exile in 1434 or the donation of the Sultan of Egypt to the Florentines in 1487 of a menagerie of exotic animals. The figure in a red toga and blue cloak sitting on a marble throne is clearly identified as Caesar by his laurel wreath. Several  older men are standing or kneeling before him, pointing to the men bearing animals and vases at the left edge of the painting.This fresco, no less than the other frescoes in the main hall of the Villa Medici at Poggio a Caiano, is brilliantly sensitive to its setting, which accounts for the angle and height of viewing and the open lighting.In 1582 Alessandro Allori added several details to the right-hand part of the picture. The original edge of the frame ran immediately behind the figure of Caesar, and his elbow extended over the frame. The parts to the right of that and the putto were added by Allori, who signed the fresco under the putto: ""Anno Domini MDXXI Andreas Sartius pingebat et A.D. MDLXXXII Alexander Allorius sequebatur."""

Several older men are standing or kneeling before him, pointing to the men bearing animals and vases at the left edge of the painting. Of all the animals that the Egyptian delegation brought to Florence, the giraffe was by far the most exciting for contemporaries.The fresco shows other animals as well: the dwarf sitting on the steps of Caesar's throne   is holding a chameleon on a tambourine; behind him sits a chimpanzee in a striped doublet, and an Oriental figure is carrying a long-tailed monkey. Another porter arrives with a cage full of blue and green parrots on his head. Finally, squatting at the foot of the steps  is an animal with a spotted coat, probably an African civet.

The entire space (which has, however, been cut down along the sides from its original size) is filled by the compact group with the Madonna in the middle, upright in contrast to the lifeless body of Christ, and the two angels with their studied and opposed features. The emotion communicated is of an absolutely direct intensity."
./images/616.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	The Last Supper	Fresco	Leonardo's Last Supperwas copied and adapted in several refectories, particularly in Lombardy. Andrea del Sarto's fresco in the former refectory of the Vallombrosan monastery of San Salvi in Florence also testifies to knowledge of Leonardo's fresco. The impact and movement of Leonardo's figural composition have been moderated. Andrea's narrative is more human and touching; it reduces the heroic drama of gestures and figures. It shows a nearly enclosed hall, in whose articulations the row of apostles is embedded. The community at table with Christ is given a formal pendant in the form of a window loggia. A charming, anecdotal subsidiary motif results: two servants are conversing in the central opening. Above the entire scene is an arch with medallions displaying the Trinity and the saints of the order.
./images/617.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	The Last Supper	Fresco	The Cenacolo of San Salvi is possibly the one which most easily lends itself to the transformation into a museum, with its fairly large interiors on the ground and first floors. It was part of a Vallombrosan convent and it passed to the Ladies of Faenza. In 1511 a contract was drawn up with Andrea del Sarto for the decoration of the Refectory. Although commissioned at the beginning of his career, it was carried out slowly and was completed between 1520-25, a particularly fine period of the work of Andrea del Sarto.Miraculously spared during the Siege of Florence in 1529-30, the fresco is placed under a large arch containing painted medallions with the Trinity and four Saints, protectors of the Vallombrosan Order. Andrea's personality and background are evident in the fresco's innovations; he appears to be influenced by Leonardo and the Roman work of Michelangelo and Raphael, revealed in a work of magnificence and pre-baroque spontaneity.

./images/622.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	PietÃÂ  with Saints	Oil on wood	This painting shows Andrea del Sarto's general movement towards a more restrained, sculptural style. It was produced in the period after Sarto fled Florence during the plague of 1523, when he took refuge at the Camaldolese convent of Luco in the Mugello east of Florence. In the quiet of the country surrounded by the attentive sisters, he painted the PietÃ  for the altar of their church.The composition of the PietÃ  is predicated on the monumental figures set directly at the picture plane. The painter imposed his preferred x-shape on the design through the interlocking characters.
./images/623.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	PietÃÂ  with Saints (detail)	Oil on wood	This detail shows Mary Magdalene and a female saint. According to sources, the face of the Virgin is a portrait of Lucrezia del Fede and that of Mary Magdalene is the effigy of Maria del Berrettaio, respectively the wife and step-daughter of the artist.
./images/625.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Disputation on the Trinity	Oil on wood	"In the same period as the Madonna of the Harpies, according to the evidence of Vasari confirmed by stylistic links, Andrea painted another great panel, for the altar of a chapel in the Augustinian church of San Gallo. At the time of the siege of Florence in 1529 it was taken to safety inside the walls, to San Jacopo tra' Fossi, as were the two earlier paintings (Noli me tangere and the Annunciation).The altarpiece features Sts Augustine, Sebastian, Lawrence, Peter Martyr, Francis and Mary Magdalen placed before an indistinct backdrop of sky and clouds resplendent with a compact image of the Trinity.The subject of the picture is not rare in central Italian painting during this period of spiritual and religious debate. We need only mention the emblematic solutions provided by Raphael for analogous themes with the Disputation on the Sacrament in the Stanza della Segnatura in the Vatican, or the Ecstasy of St Cecilia, painted in 1514 for the church of San Giovanni in Monte at Bologna. Moreover, it was particularly congenial to the Augustinian clients of the monastery of San Gallo, who wished to present a theme dear to St Augustine, who is in fact depicted while leading a lively debate among other saints, in the presence of a stupendous Magdalene with the features of Lucrezia kneeling beside St Sebastian.We get the best possible idea of the admiration aroused by the picture from the enthusiastic words of Bocchi: ""In this church there are three wonderful pictures by Andrea del Sarto: but the one on the right, with saints disputing about the Trinity, is of all pictures in all places the most wonderful. In this picture we see what a lively colouring, a drawing of rare quality, a unique mastery, can do. Who ever saw clothing so lifelike, or the reliefs of surfaces so marked, the features of persons so vivid, and liveliness so conforming with the truth?. . . It does not seem as if these figures were made of paint, but of flesh; not clothed by artifice, but by nature. But if for a moment we put aside the colours, and the artifice, we enter into the spirit of that which is true beyond any doubt; and it seems that the persons are thinking, and adopting bodily attitudes, and talking, and are anything other than painted.""The only additions one can make to this admiring judgment from the past arise from the recuperation of the exceptional colours of the Disputation, obtained by a restoration that has only just been completed. Apart from certain irreversible alterations, such as the oxidization of the verdigris spread by the painter on the mantle of St Sebastian in order to emphasize the effect of shadow in the folds, and apart from missing parts and abrasions caused by previous cleanings, the removal - or the careful and extremely prudent reduction - of the layers of dirt and coloured varnishes deposited over the surface in the course of centuries has enabled us to rediscover warm, intense and most refined harmonies of colour set against the deep blue-green space of a stormy sky. The ""palette"" now revealed to us appears very similar indeed to that of the Madonna of the Harpies, and confirms the theory that these two masterpieces date from the same time."
./images/627.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Madonna della Scala	Oil on panel	The painting contains numerous exact quotations of Michelangelo and Raphael, though these are fused by Andrea in his own assured manner that gives form to a heroic and yet gentle humanity, and in an equilibrium that both enchants and involves the onlooker.The structure of the painting, representing the Holy Family and the Angel, is complex and based on a pyramid: at the apex is the Madonna, kneeling humbly and lovingly holding the tender boy of the Child reaching out towards the angel, who, together with St Joseph, composes the base of the composition. The links between the group and the landscape are supplied by the horizontal line of steps. On this plane he has placed the powerful figure of St Elizabeth, who, according to a story in the apocryphal Gospels, is leading the little Baptist off by the hand in order to escape the persecutions of Herod, going towards the vast blue spaces of the hills and mountains.
./images/628.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Assumption of the Virgin	Oil on wood	This large altarpiece, called  Assunta Passerini, represents the miracle of the Assumption of the Virgin. The subject illustrates an ancient tradition, according to which Mary, being deprived of original sin, is the only one to be welcomed in heaven with the body and with the soul.Adapting the project he had previously developed for the Assunta Panciatichi, also at the Palatine Gallery, Andrea del Sarto proposes the typical iconographic scheme of the Renaissance, in which the scene of the assumption and that of the apostles are depicted together, on two levels. In the group of the apostles, we can identify St Nicholas and St Margaret, both kneeling, in the foreground. Looking towards the public, the first one wears a pink silk cope and is accompanied by the episcopal mitre, a book and the three golden spheres of the dowry which he gave to three poor young girls (his traditional attributes); St Margaret da Cortona is portrayed as a Franciscan tertiary, with a habit and a white veil. The presence of these two saints is explained by the commissioning of the painting: the altarpiece was in fact requested by Margherita Passerini between 1526 and 1528 for the high altar of Santa Maria dei Servi in Cortona. Both the father and the prematurely departed son of Margaret were called Nicholas, whose saint of reference is St Nicholas.The altarpiece combines clarity and dimness, substance and dissolution, reality and vision, in a manner that suggests some of the development of the Italian Baroque that would follow in the seventeenth century.
./images/629.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Assumption of the Virgin (detail)	Oil on wood	The face of Mary in Andrea's huge Assumption bears the features of his wife. Seated on clouds, her hands folded in prayer, she is surrounded by sturdy putti.
./images/630.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Assumption of the Virgin	Oil on wood	Vasari records this as being executed around 1529 for Bartolommeo Panciatichi the Elder. Andrea began it and carried it out almost to the end, but because the panel split several times as the work was begun and then suspended, the picture remained not entirely finished at his death.In this immense panel we have one of the most important work of Andrea (who is there represented in the person of the Apostle seen from the back, half-turned towards the spectator) on account of the fine composition divided between earth and sky, the figure of the standing Apostle serving as link between these parts.
./images/631.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	St John the Baptist	Oil on wood	This is a celebrated picture. Although actually disfigured by bad restorations in old times which have changed the background and diminished the splendor and especially the interrelation of colors, there still remains the frank, original and lively conception of this youthful figure.The impressive image of the young Baptist, of an evocative power that in this case also one might call pre-Baroque, emerges from a dark grey background in which one glimpses the slightly pinkish rockface of a grotto. The athletic figure, the animal skin and the cloak are thrown into relief by a dramatic light that still illumines wonderful pictorial effects visible in the better preserved parts, such as the cross made of cane in the lower corner. These are the effects that will be taken up again by many of the Florentine painters of the 17th century.

./images/634.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Holy Family (Barberini)	Oil on wood	In his biography of Andrea del Sarto, Vasari mentions this painting right after a panel of the same subject painted for Zanobi Bracci. The latter picture survives: given to Cardinal Ferdinando de Medici it is now in the Galleria Palatina at the Palazzo Pitti in Florence. The picture now in Rome, painted for the same Zanobi, was originally installed in the chapel of the Villa di Rovezzano.Numerous copies of this celebrated work exist. Art historians set the date of the composition at 1528-29, comparing it to the Madonna, St Elizabeth and St John the Baptist that Andrea executed for Ottaviano de' Medici. The figure of St Joseph is clearly related to the Raphaelesque model of the Louvre Sacred Family, once owned by King FranÃ§ois I.
./images/635.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Virgin and Child in Glory with Six Saints	Oil on wood	Vasari mentions this panel as having been painted for Becuccio, a glassmaker, from Gambassi, and adds that it had a predella with the lively portraits of Becuccio and his wife. (The two little tondi with the portraits are now in Chicago.) The represented saints are Lawrence, Onophrius, John the Baptist, Mary Magdalen, Sebastian and Roch. he panel was placed to an altar dedicated to the hermit saints Lawrence and Onophrius in the female monastery of the Eremite Benedictines, the Pieve di Sta Maria a Chianni a Gambassi.The design is symmetrical, forming a three-dimensional pyramid with the saints circled round the raised divine centre, with those in front kneeling down to admit the viewer's eye past them to the Virgin located further back in the space. The painting well represents the late style of Andrea.
./images/636.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Virgin and Child in Glory with Six Saints (detail)	Oil on wood	The detail represents the figure of St Roch.
./images/637.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	St James	Oil on canvas	"In this painting Andrea del Sarto appears to reflect on an archaising iconography in the style of Fra Bartolomeo. The figure is large and dominant, yet the proportions between the masses and the space are accurate. Even the extended spreading of the colours seems intended to lighten the weight of the figure, which due to the faint and uncertain light stands alone and isolated against the background surroundings.It is the standard of the Compagnia di San Jacopo del Nicchio. The two children wear the costume of the ""battuti"". It is a late work and very beautiful.The painting was restored in 1989."
./images/638.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Madonna del sacco (Madonna with the Sack)	Fresco	"Returning to the quarter of the SS. Annunziata after the plague, in 1525 Andrea painted one of his most celebrated works in the great cloister, known as the ""Chiostro dei morti"". It is considered to be the ultimate masterpiece of Andrea del Sarto's classicism. The solemn equilibrium, the quality of repose and grandeur, the supreme elegance of this scene illustrating the Rest during the Flight into Egypt, classically framed by the high step and the two pilasters, but laid out in an unconventional manner, make this fresco one of the loftiest achievements of the late phase of Andrea's art. The influence of Michelangelo (a number of figures on the vault of the Sistine Chapel are mentioned as prototypes) are elements in a language which is totally personal, powerful and mature."
./images/640.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Annunciation	Oil on wood	The painting was mentioned by Vasari as being the lunette of a picture which, after various wanderings passed to the museum of Berlin and was destroyed there in the Second World War. It had in fact the form of a lunette and was transformed to a rectangle at an unknown period. It is a late painting of Andrea.In a supremely poetic range of changing colours, from yellow to pink to lilac to purple, it expresses Andrea's new taste, no longer favouring the intense and highly charged palette of the preceding years; he now chooses delicate harmonies, without dissonances, and of precious and refined accords which give the composition a new balance, more quiet and refined than before.
./images/641.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Annunciation (detail)	Oil on wood	The detail shows the Archangel Gabriel. The night-blue drapery at the corner was added later to what was originally a lunette crowning an altarpiece.

./images/643.jpg	ANDREA DEL SARTO	Sts Michael and John Gualbert	Tempera on wood	This painting is part of an altarpiece for the church at Vallombrosa, near Florence, home of the monastic community reformed by St John Gualbert (Giovanni Gualberto) in the eleventh century. Even though St John is the patron saint of Florence, the date, 1528, is below St Michael the Archangel, the highest ranking figure in this hierarchy.

./images/647.jpg	ANDREA DI BARTOLO	Coronation of the Virgin	Oil on panel	This polyptych, originating from the convent of Santa Caterina d'Alessandria in Saant'Angelo in Vado (near Urbino), was executed with the collaboration of the painter's son, Giorgio di Andrea (active 1410-1428). The four saints on the side panels are Catherine of Alexandria, Augustine, Peter, and Paul. Originally the polyptych had five side panels, the missing two, representing Sts Michael and John the Baptist, are in the Galleria Nazionale delle Marche in Urbino.

At Barbizon he was tutored by Grigorescu. he exhibited small landscapes in the 1879, 1880 and 1881 Paris Salons.Andreescu's pictures tend to suggest fresh delight in the beauty of Nature, relish of its colours. He was forever trying to create fresh, harmonious art out of what he saw. The rich colours of grass, foliage, rocks, and sky, and the structural appearance of trees in the woods at Fontainebleau, exerted a continual attraction.

./images/677.jpg	ANESI, Paolo	An Extensive Landscape	Oil on canvas	Two extensive landscapes constitute the only known examples of a collaboration between Gian Paolo Panini, the most celebrated view-painter in 18th-century Rome, and Paolo Anesi, arguably the most accomplished landscapist of his time. Both paintings were almost certainly designed by Panini, as the numerous related preparatory drawings suggest, but the landscapes in both works were executed by Anesi. Anesi seems to have been responsible for the landscapes and distant figures in each painting, whilst Panini executed the main protagonists and buildings in the foreground.The present extensive landscape depicts villas and figures, including Pannini himself, dining beneath a pergola in the foreground. The pendant extensive landscape depicts carriages and elegant figures on a road, including Pannini himself, gardens and fields on either side.

./images/685.jpg	ANGELI, Giuseppe	View of the ballroom	Fresco	The villa of the Widmann family stands along the banks of the Brenta River near Mira. The existing structure is the result of a reconstruction carried out in 1719. In the 1750s, the interior of the villa was modified by creating a central hall, a ballroom, the height of the two preexisting floors and providing it with a balcony that circles the entire perimeter. The pictorial decoration of this room is the work of Giuseppe Angeli.The decoration of the ballroom cover the entire wall surface, the intricate trompe-l'oeil architecture, attributed to Francesco Zanchi (active 1734-1772), is especially significant, in some areas even tends to reduce the space reserved for the figure painter. The overall effect is grandiose and highly refined.The two large scenes that extend between the doors on the walls are taken from Greek mythology and depict The Sacrifice of Iphigenia and The Abduction of Helen.
./images/686.jpg	ANGELI, Giuseppe	The Sacrifice of Iphigenia	Fresco	The two large scenes that extend between the doors on the walls in the ballroom are taken from Greek mythology and depict The Sacrifice of Iphigenia and The Abduction of Helen.The Sacrifice of Iphigenia shows the moment when the priest is about to inflict the mortal knife blow upon Agamemnon's young daughter, who is condemned to be sacrificed to Diana to atone for the insult to the goddess caused by Agamemnon, who killed her sacred stag during a hunt. At the last moment, the goddess, moved by the young girl's tragic fate, has a stag descend from the sky to be sacrificed in place of Iphigenia, who in turn will become one of Diana's priestesses.
./images/687.jpg	ANGELI, Giuseppe	The Abduction of Helen	Fresco	The two large scenes that extend between the doors on the walls in the ballroom are taken from Greek mythology and depict The Sacrifice of Iphigenia and The Abduction of Helen.The Abduction of Helen is more agitated and theatrical than the other scene. It depicts the abduction of Queen Helen, beautiful wife of Menelaus, seized against her will by Paris and his Troyan soldiers and brought aboard a ship that is about to set sail.
./images/689.jpg	ANGELI, Giuseppe	View of the ceiling in the ballroom	Fresco	The ceiling opens up to a blue sky, with a whimsical, lively framework that allows a glimpse of the celestial depths, also visible in four side compartments.

./images/703.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	San Domenico Altarpiece (detail)	Tempera on wood	This is the centre part of the altarpiece painted for the altar of the church of San Domenico at Fiesole, just outside Florence. Originally a triptych, it was radically altered into a single panel in 1501. In the centre the Virgin and Child enthroned with eight angels is depicted, while on the left part St Thomas of Aquino and St Barnaba, on the right St Dominic and St Peter the Martyr are represented (not seen in this detail). The seven pictures of the predella now are in the National Gallery in London.The eight angels in front, beside, and behind her create the space in which the Virgin sits. The Virgin's gown falls in a restrained manner, her head inclined to one side. The plump cheeks and closely curled hair of Christ and the angels owe much to the manner of Gentile da Fabriano, exponent of the fourteenth-century International Gothic style, who was the dominant painter in Florence during his stay there from 1422 to 1425/6.
./images/705.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Predella of the San Domenico Altarpiece	Tempera and gold on panel	The San Domenico Altarpiece at Fiesole adorned the high altar, located in the choir, where the friars sang hymns as they celebrated the Divine Office. Only the friars would have been privileged to view the predella in all its detail, as they knelt before the altarpiece. Nearly 300 miniature angels, Old Testament prophets, New Testament saints and Dominican worthies are identified by their distinctive features, attributes and garments as well as by inscriptions. The figures turn toward the central panel, where the resurrected Christ ascends heavenward among throngs of angels acclaiming his majesty with music and prayer.The predella is now separated from the altarpiece and exhibited in the National Gallery, London.

./images/712.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	The Annunciation	Tempera on wood	The Annunciation (154 x 194 cm) is the main painting on the altarpiece known as the Prado Altarpiece. There are five small (23 x 35 cm each) predella pictures below the Annunciation, painted on the same panel, depicting the story of the Virgin. The altarpiece, and especially the predella paintings are of extremely high quality thus without any doubts they are the works of Fra Angelico. The central image repeats a design Fra Angelico also used in an Annunciation in Cortona and in another at the head of the stairs to the dormitory of his monastery, San Marco in Florence. The new Renaissance command of architectural perspective accompanies a continuing medieval delight in the lavish use of gilding.The painting comes from the Church of San Domenico in Fiesole, it was sold and taken to Spain in 1611.

./images/718.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Linaioli Tabernacle (shutters closed)	Tempera on panel	The Arte de' Linaiuoli, the Guild of Linen Manufacturers, commissioned this altarpiece from Angelico in 1432, for the Residenza of the Guild in the Piazza Sant' Andrea in Florence. The mammoth marble frame, 520 cm high and 270 cm wide, was designed by Ghiberti and executed by three craftsmen in his workshop. It is firmly classical, with round arch, dental cornice, and pediment.On the outside of the doors are two monumental and statuesque figures: St Mark and St Peter. Both stand on flat but irregularly edged rocks. The background is dark and unarticulated: there is no attempt to claim it for the picture space. St Mark's lion crouches behind his right leg. St Peter holds his key and gazes heavenwards.
./images/719.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Linaioli Tabernacle (shutters open)	Tempera on panel	The doors of the triptych open to reveal the Virgin and Child Enthroned with St John the Baptist and St Mark. The two saints have the same three-dimensional qualities as their companions on the outside of the triptych. St John the Baptist is shown with his right arm curved round and up across his chest and left shoulder, and the top of his cross pushed back away from the viewer. The right foot is to the fore. The extended hand of St Mark on the Virgin's right draws the eye into the space occupied by the figure.The central panel of The Virgin and Child differs from its predecessors in Angelico's oeuvre in the absence of a circle of space-defining angels. Greater realism is achieved by translating part of the traditional gold background into elaborate golden curtains which frame the Virgin, the outline thus created echoing a pointed arch. She has the same solidity and three-dimensional qualities as the saints in the work. The Child is clothed and stands upright holding His arms out in blessing. He lacks the overtly puerile qualities of many infant Christ's of the Renaissance and as a result appears medieval or Byzantine.
./images/720.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Linaioli Tabernacle: St John the Baptist	Tempera on panel	St John the Baptist is depicted on the left wing of the Linaioli tabernacle, while on the right wing St John the Evangelist can be seen. These two figures form part of a work that in 1433 opened the way to a new horizon for early renaissance religious painting.

./images/722.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Linaioli Tabernacle (detail)	Tempera on wood	The altarpiece called Linaioli Tabernacle was executed for the Arte dei Linaioli (Guild of Flaxmakers). The central panel depicting the Madonna and the Child is surrounded by a band of 20 cm width which contains 12 angels playing different musical instruments. This band can be seen only when the tabernacle is open. These angels are among the most famous and most popular paintings of Fra Angelico.

./images/727.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Last Judgment	Tempera on panel	Elevated in the deep azure sky and surrounded by concentric rings of cherubim and angels, Christ sits on a glowing bank of clouds as he judges the world. He is flanked by the interceding figures of John the Baptist and the Virgin. Rows of saints and prophets, identified by their distinctive attributes, varied expressions and brilliantly coloured mantles, sit suspended on clouds in the heavens. A long row of tombs leads to the distant horizon, bisecting the valley below. To the right of Christ, the Blessed kneel in adoration, their faces radiant with the love of God, as angels dance in a circle in the verdant vegetation of Paradise. Golden rays of light stream through the open gates of the City of God and illuminate the white gowns of the Blessed seeking entry. To Christ's left, demons with pitchforks drive the agonized Damned into the mouth of a mountainous Hell. The ghastly torments that await them are portrayed within its flaming circles, where naked sinners, some strangled with snakes, suffer for their transgressions.The abundance of figures (270 in all), nuanced evocation of their emotions, descending perspective of the row of tombs and ascending landscape reveal a mastery of narrative and space that was unprecedented in Angelico's small-scale works.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 8 minutes):Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart: Requiem K 626: Dies irae

./images/730.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Last Judgment (detail)	Tempera on panel	This detail is from the right side of the panel.
./images/731.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Last Judgment (detail)	Tempera on panel	The large receding rectangle of empty tombs creates the depth in the bottom half of this picture. An empty sarcophagus laid across it in the foreground subtly reduces the emphasis on this axis. Originally forming part of a seat, the complete picture extends to either side to show paradise and hell, but these scenes are thought to be by Angelico's workshop. Beside the empty tombs stand the judged; the saved with radiant heads exit left to paradise; and demons drive the nimbus-less damned to the right, down to hell.In the upper part of the panel Christ sits in jjudgment in a mandorla framed by a border of angels. On his right is the Virgin and on his left St John the Baptist. Beyond them on each side are two tiers of seated apostles and saints. The spatial depth of the terrestrial part of the picture is not maintained in the celestial half, the slight angling of the two banks of saints failing to give heaven the same illusion of depth.
./images/732.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Last Judgment (detail)	Tempera on panel	The detail shows the Hell from the right side of the painting.
./images/733.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Annunciation	Tempera on wood	The painting is a repetition of the main panel of the Prado Altarpiece in a more refined architectural setting. The altarpiece is the work of Fra Angelico with an intervention of his collaborators only in the predella pictures.
./images/734.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Annunciation	Tempera on wood	In a loggia of columns and arches, the angel appears to Mary. Shown in profile, he occupies the larger part of the painting, his richly painted wings extending out through the colonnade, their upper tips marking the centre of the picture. He declaims to the Virgin, 'the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee' (Luke 1, v. 35). She, demure, with a dove fluttering above her head in a burst of golden light, inclines towards him and responds, 'Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word' (Luke 1, v. 38). Beyond them the picture space extends into the Virgin's chamber, and further, hidden space is hinted at by the bed curtain there which serves also to set off Gabriel's nimbus.Outside the loggia is a delicately painted garden, enclosed by a palisade, symbolic of Mary's virginity. Carved in a roundel above the centre column is a half-length effigy of Isaiah, who had prophesied the birth of a child to a virgin. The pink entablature of the loggia points to the second reference to the Old Testament, in the top left corner, where Adam and Eve are expelled from Paradise.Undoubtedly Angelico's first truly great painting, this Annunciation formed a prototype for a noble line of derivatives.

./images/738.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Birth of the Virgin	Tempera on wood	In the predella below the Annunciation, near the two farthest edges, two scenes are painted. The first represent the Birth of the Virgin, the other The Virgin Consigns the Habit to St Dominic. There are five central scenes of the life of the Virgin, one after the other without interruption, namely (from the left). Marriage of the Virgin, The Visitation, Adoration of the Magi, Presentation of Jesus at the Temple, Death of the Virgin.This picture shows the scene of the Birth of the Virgin.
./images/739.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Marriage of the Virgin	Tempera on wood	In the predella below the Annunciation, near the two farthest edges, two scenes are painted (23 x 14 cm each).

./images/740.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Visitation	Tempera on wood	In the predella below the Annunciation, near the two farthest edges, two scenes are painted (23 x 14 cm each). The first represent the Birth of the Virgin, the other The Virgin Consigns the Habit to St Dominic. There are five central scenes of the life of the Virgin, one after the other without interruption (23 x 183 cm), namely (from the left). Marriage of the Virgin, The Visitation, Adoration of the Magi, Presentation of Jesus at the Temple, Death of the Virgin.This picture shows the scene of the Visitation. The event shown here is described in the Gospel of Luke. Immediately following the Annunciation, Mary 'went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Juda; and entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth' (Luke 1, v. 39-40). The Virgin and Elisabeth embrace, the straight folds of their gowns showing a simplicity and reserve alien to the curvilinear trecento influences of some ofAngelico's mentors and contemporaries. Elisabeth, six months pregnant with John the Baptist, is given a wider girth than her cousin. Juda is represented by a series of simple, geometric forms, sharply lit but slightly thin and awkward. A woman makes her way up the hill path which lies in shadow below her. Behind her the sky and earth meet in the haze of a Tuscan summer.This is the first identifiable landscape in Italian art. In the middle distance a lake, which no longer exists, spreads out in the Chiana Valley; beyond rises the town of Castigliona Florentino, and further distant the tower of Monterchi.

In this scene Joseph, the Virgin, the High Priest and St Anne stand in the foreground, a nave of receding columns extending backwards behind them. Exterior space is hinted at by the doorway to the left, the round window in the apse, the edge of the top light high above the nave and the strong light hitting the foreground from a source outside the picture space.

./images/745.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Cortona Polyptych	Tempera and gold on panel	This polyptych, as shown by the recent restoration work, emerges from the combination of three wood panels of which it is formed, put together with the upper part and the border below. Therefore the three works must have been painted at different times and for different reasons. On the top are represented the Annunciation and the Crucifixion. In the middle of the polyptych there is a Virgin and Child. On the left Sts John the Baptist and John the Evangelist, while on the right Sts Matthew and Mary Magdalen are represented. On the predella episodes from the life of St Dominic, and other images of saints and angels are represented.Art critics tend to date the older wood painting, the one with the Virgin, to 1434 and the complete work to 1437.The triptych was placed on a lateral altar in the church of St Dominic in Cortona. At the beginning of the Second World War it was immured in the belfry where the wood suffered much damage due to humidity and temperatures. It was necessary to detach the painted surface and transfer it to a new base. It has been restored after many succeeding interventions. Unfortunately, it has lost its original solidity and need continuous reexamination.
./images/746.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Cortona Polyptych (central panel)	Tempera and gold on panel	This Madonna with the Child and Angels is the central part of the altarpiece called Cortona Triptych. On the left panel St John the Evangelist and St John the Baptist, on the right panel St Mark and St Mary Magdalen are depicted. The ten predella pictures show episodes of the life of Saint Dominic and standing figures of saints. The altarpiece was damaged during the second World War and restored in 1946-50.

./images/756.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Perugia Altarpiece (in modern frame)	Tempera and gold on panel	The picture shows the Perugia Altarpiece in a modern, early twentieth-century frame. The left and centre predella panels are copies of originals now in the Pinacoteca, Vatican.The altarpiece is one of Angelico's most beautiful paintings. Until recently it was believed that its patron was Benedetto Guidalotti (1388-1429), archbishop of Recanati. New research, however, indicates instead that his sister Elisabetta (died 1460) may have been responsible for the project. Prominently located in the transept of San Domenico, the triptych conveyed the devotion of the Guidalotti to the Virgin and the saints worshipped in the church. The diverse saints on the pilasters, almost all bearing books, reflect the commitment to scholarship by the Order that shared by the Guidalotti.The triptych was completely dismembered nearly two centuries ago, when its frame was destroyed, the panels cut apart and the predella dispersed.
./images/757.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Perugia Altarpiece	Tempera and gold on panel	The picture shows the Perugia polyptych, without the complete predella.
./images/758.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Perugia Altarpiece (central panel)	Tempera and gold on panel	This panel, representing the Virgin and Child Enthroned with Four Angels, was at the centre of a polyptych painted for the St Nicholas chapel in the church of San Domenico at Perugia. The side panels represent St Dominic and St Nicholas of Bari, as well as St John the Baptist and St Catherine of Alexandria. The work is now displayed without its original frame, and the area which this covered can easily be seen along the upper edge of the panel. Compared with the Linaiuoli altarpiece, this Virgin is less monumental and the Child altogether more sinuous and fleshy. Angelico returns to the circle of angels to create an additional sense of depth, but here the two who would have stood forward of the throne have been replaced by three vases of flowers. The Virgin's throne is a solid classical affair with round arch and pilasters, topped with a swagged frieze. The background of the panel is still gold and abstract.
./images/759.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Perugia Altarpiece (left panel)	Tempera and gold on panel	St Dominic and St Nicholas of Bari stand to the Virgin's right. They lack the sculptural monumentality of the saints in the Linaiuoli altarpiece, are lit in a softer and more diffuse manner, and are not made to stand in a darkened niche. Here, for the first time Angelico breaks away from the convention of the abstract, all-surrounding gold, and places the figures in front of a long table, whose end can be seen behind St Nicholas of Bari who has placed his mitre on it. This is not, however, so great a departure from convention as might be implied, as the table is covered with a golden cloth and beyond it is the usual gold background.The two figures stand at the very front of the space created, St Dominic's foot and St Nicholas's vestments touching the edge of the step. St Nicholas wears his bishop's cope and supports his crook, while at his feet are three full leather bags. These refer to the most popular legend concerning this fourth-century churchman. He reputedly tossed bags of gold through the open window of a house, providing the three women who lived within with dowries and thus saving them from turning to prostitution. The event is shown, with two other scenes from the saint's life, in one of the predella panels from the altarpiece.
./images/760.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Perugia Altarpiece (right panel)	Tempera and gold on panel	St John the Baptist and St Catherine of Alexandria stand at the edge of the step and, like their companion saints in the altarpiece, have a table running behind them. St John's cross is tucked nonchalantly behind his halo and the base of it sticks right forward, but neither this nor his foreshortened hand recreate the impression of three-dimensionality with which he was rendered in the Linaiuoli altarpiece. He holds a scroll with a quotation from his own words, 'Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world', (John 1, v. 29). St Catherine has fewer sculptural qualities still. Beside her is a broken wheel from the diabolical machine on which she was tested. Some critics see the hand of assistants, rather than primarily that of the master, in these two figures.
./images/761.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	The Story of St Nicholas	Tempera and gold on panel	The large altarpiece, called Perugia Triptych and executed for the Cappella di San NiccolÃ² of the church San Domenico at Perugia, contained three main panels, a predella with three pictures, and two decorated side pilasters. It was dismembered in later centeries. The majority of the parts are in the Galleria Nazionale dell'Umbria at Perugia, while two of the predella paintings are in the Vatican.The central part of the triptych represents the Madonna with the Child and Angels, while on the side parts four saints are shown. The predella depicts the story of St Nicholas.The first predella painting (this picture) shows the birth of St Nicholas (on the left), The Vocation of St Nicholas (in the center) and the Giving Dowry to Three Poor Girls (on the right).This scene refers to the most popular legend concerning this fourth-century churchman. He reputedly tossed bags of gold through the open window of a house, providing the three women who lived within with dowries and thus saving them from turning to prostitution. The event is shown, with two other scenes from the saint's life, in one of the predella panels from the altarpiece.

./images/770.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	San Marco Altarpiece	Tempera on wood	This is the main painting of the altarpiece, called San Marco Altarpiece. It represents the Virgin and Child Enthroned with Angels and Saints, it was executed for the main altar of the church belonging to the Convent of San Marco and dedicated to the two medical saints, Cosmas and Damian.The altarpiece, one of the most grandiose of the Quattrocento altars,  was executed after the decision of Cosimo de' Medici in 1438 to transfer to Cortona the triptych which served as main altar of the convent church. It depicts, in the front, the kneeling Sts Cosmas and Damian, then in the second row, from the left: Sts Lawrence, John the Evangelist, Mark, Dominic, Francis and Peter the Martyr. It is assumed that the figure of St Cosmas is the likeness of Cosimo de' Medici. In the lower center a Crucifixion with golden background can be seen.
./images/772.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	The Healing of Palladia by Saint Cosmas and Saint Damian	Tempera and gold on panel	The predella of the San Marco Altarpiece contained scenes from the lives of Sts Cosmas and Damian. According to the reconstruction, the predella consisted of seven frontal and two lateral panels. The narratives that extended continuously across the foot of the altarpiece were conceived with great imagination as well as geometric rigour.On this picture, which was placed on the left lateral side of the predella, two consecutive episodes are shown. On the left the two Arab physicians effect a miraculous cure; on the right Saint Damian, contrary to his vows, unwillingly accepts a gift.
./images/773.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Saint Cosmas and Saint Damian before Lisius	Tempera on wood	This picture is the first from the left on the predella.
./images/774.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Saint Cosmas and Saint Damian Salvaged	Tempera and gold on panel	This picture is the second from the left on the predella.In this scene the saints' prayer to God, the judge's attack by demons and their salvation by angels are represented in varied scale throughout the landscape to connote different moments in time. The undulating forms of the landscape recede and flatten as they approach the horizon, itself dissolved in the mist of atmospheric perspective. The figures are more intensely characterized through their varied ages, garments, postures and expressions.
./images/775.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Saint Cosmas and Saint Damian Condamned	Tempera on wood	This picture is the third from the left on the predella.
./images/776.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Entombment	Tempera on wood	This panel was part of the altarpiece of the main altar in the monastery church of San Marco, Florence, and was originally in the middle of its predella.The centre predella panel of the San Marco altarpiece is not overtly connected to the scenes on either side of it, which show the life of Sts Cosmas and Damian, although it too is lit from the right. Instead it relates directly to the crucifixion at the base of the altarpiece which, when the predella was in situ, was immediately above it. Christ's body is supported by Nicodemus, and his hands are held and kissed by the stooping Virgin and St John. Christ has a weightless air about him, so that the three other figures appear to have to do little to support him. The winding cloth lies stretched out in a receding rectangle creating the foreground space, its folds and colour echoing the white rock. Behind lies the dark rectangular void of the tomb. The sparsity and simplicity of the composition, the firmly closed-off space and the extensive use of white in this panel, are all also found in Angelico's frescoes at San Marco.The figures here, arranged parallel with each other, with the central perspective of the shroud leading to the tomb, shows a very different idea of spatial organization from that inRogier van der Weyden's panelof the same subject.

./images/778.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Beheading of Saint Cosmas and Saint Damian	Tempera on wood	This picture is the second from the right on the predella. The legend of Sts Cosmas and Damian, twin brothers who were famed for making no charges for their services as physicians, is outlined in the predella panels of this San Marco altarpiece. Several attempts to put them to death failed, until the last, pictured here. The final moments of the two brothers are shown set against one of Angelico's finest landscapes. Outside a town with fortifications akin to those of Jerusalem in his Deposition, the two saints wait to join the three headless figures in the foreground. The greatest emphasis falls on the one who kneels directly in front of a row of five cypresses which runs parallel to the picture plane. The trees can be taken to symbolize the five being executed.

./images/780.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	The Healing of Justinian by Saint Cosmas and Saint Damian	Tempera on wood	This picture was placed on the right lateral side of the predella. Justinian sleeps while Sts Cosmas and Damian enter his chamber trailing patches of soft cloud. They replace his corrupted leg with a healthy one. The room is Spartan but the variety of light-sources and Angelico's close observation give it interest. Light floods in from outside through the window on the left, illuminating its own frame and parts of the swags of curtain. Exterior space is indicated not only by the window but by the door opposite it, from whence comes more light. From the front left outside the picture comes the third source of light, which produces a broad diagonal sweep across the right wall. The curtain provides the rectangular backdrop parallel to the picture surface which is common to each of these predella panels, and also hints at more, obscured space behind it. The container hanging from a nail on the side of the bed, the glass and decanter, the slippers and the simple three-legged stool, all provide the constituents of a closely observed still-life.

./images/787.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Deposition from the Cross (Pala di Santa TrinitÃÂ )	Tempera on panel	This work was originally commissioned by Palla Strozzi from Lorenzo Monaco, for the sacristy of the church of Santa TrinitÃ  in Florence, but by the time of Monaco's death only the pinnacles of this work had been painted. When Angelico took over the commission he found himself cribbed and confined by Monaco's ready-made triple-arched Gothic frame. He ignored these constraints, however, making skilful use of the three arches in his composition to provide a scene of stunning beauty and subdued yet poignant emotion, set in an expansive Tuscan landscape. Although the work is painted on one panel, the three arches of the frame find an echo in the placing of the figures in three groups.The central arch is largely blocked off by the wooden framework of the cross and two ladders. The cross bar of the former appears to run behind the picture frame hinting at further, obscured space. With no scene behind but the sky and the lattice work of timber, the eye is drawn to the body of Christ which is at the very centre of the picture. Angelico challenges the tendency of the other two arches to define the shape and space of the work by placing a strong vertical, in the form of a tower or a tree, in the corners of each. The pilasters on either side of the frame contain twelve panels with full length portraits of saints, and eight medallions with portrait busts. The full-length figures are shown standing on columns which are each painted with careful attention to the view-point of the spectator.
./images/789.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Deposition from the Cross (detail)	Tempera on panel	The cross has no upper limb, thereby blunting the pointedness of the arch behind which it stands. There is room at the top only for a view of the mocking panel which declares Christ King of the Jews. Christ is covered with the weals of the flagellation, and blood trickles from the lance wound in his side. More blood runs down the cross to the rock at the base, a stylized representation of Golgotha. Christ's head lies almost horizontally, his passive face marked only by thin dribbles of blood from the pricks of the crown of thorns.Vasari claims that one of the figures lowering Christ is a portrait of Michelozzo, the architect responsible for the rebuilding of the convent of San Marco in Florence. Pope-Hennessy suggests that if he is represented at all it is in the figure under Christ's right arm wearing a black cappucio, or monastic hood.
./images/790.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Deposition from the Cross (detail)	Tempera on panel	In the distance at the top left lies Jerusalem, shown by Angelico as a sparkling Tuscan hill town. The city fortifications appear as a series of cubes, pillars, and walls massed together in a sharply defining light. Buildings of widely varying sizes, shapes and colours are arranged together within the city walls. At the top of the hill rises a citadel-like temple. Outside the city gates lies a landscape of ploughed fields, farmhouses, and hedgerows. In the sky, above a storm cloud is gathering which throws shadow over half the city. The whole is viewed through a screen of trees, which mark out the middle distance in the complete picture.
./images/791.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Deposition from the Cross (detail)	Tempera on panel	In this detail the towered buildings confirm the landscape as Italian. The hills stretch out into the distance, softened and smoothed by the light, peppered with gleaming villages and farmhouses. The foreground rocks are insufficiently distant to be mellowed, and are shown with all their facets and angularity. A row of trees again screens the landscape, emphasizing its distance.
./images/792.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Deposition from the Cross (detail)	Tempera on panel	Angelico stops short of portraying the figures lamenting Christ's death in the agonies of grief; instead he shows them in languorous contemplation of their inner sorrow. Mary Magdalen kneels before Christ, taking his feet in her hands and kissing them. The Virgin kneels, her hands clasped, head on one side in reflective misery, with an air of particular detachment. She is partly screened from the viewer by the winding sheet held before her. The other holy women stand in positions of contemplation or prayer; one wipes a tear from her eye. As in earlier paintings by Angelico, the sense of the space in which the Virgin kneels is created by placing figures in a circle around her. In the background the road begins to wind its way up to Jerusalem.
./images/793.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Deposition from the Cross (detail)	Tempera on panel	Kneeling in the foreground of the picture is a Beato. He echoes the Magdalen in his position, pose and red gown. A foreshortened arm extends out towards the viewer, drawing us into the scene before us. It has been suggested that this figure is Alessio degli Strozzi, the dead son of the family whose patronage brought about the creation of the work. Behind him are five men, standing further forward in the picture plane than the women on the other side whom they balance. Like the women each is contemplative, reticent and mournful. One displays to the others some of the instruments of crucifixion: three gruesomely large nails with heavy drips of blood on them, and the neatly woven circlet of thorns whose perforations can be seen on Christ's brow. Beneath their feet, indicative of Angelico's enjoyment of the portrayal of nature, is the richly leafed and flowered turf which is common to so many of his paintings.
./images/794.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Deposition from the Cross (detail)	Tempera on wood	This detail demonstrates Fra Angelico's skillful treatment of landscapes.
./images/795.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Deposition from the Cross (detail)	Tempera on wood	Fra Angelico's Deposition demonstrates not only his skillful treatment of landscapes, but also figures, to which he often gave specific and presumably identifiable features. The man in the turban is likely a portrait of a person known to the artist.
./images/796.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Noli Me Tangere (Cell 1)	Fresco	This is the fresco on the wall of Cell 1 of the Convento di San Marco in Florence.The brilliance of the early morning is real enough, but the irradiating light, the floating rather than walking figure of Christ, the wealth of natural detail in the garden, are for devotional reasons and intended  to stimulate the meditation of the monk who lived in the cell.
./images/797.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Lamentation over Christ (Cell 2)	Fresco	This is the fresco on the wall of Cell 2 of the Convento di San Marco in Florence. It is one of the first frescoes in the convent.
./images/798.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	View of Cell 3	Fresco	The picture shows a view of Cell 3 of the Convento di San Marco in Florence. The fresco on the wall depicts the scene of the Annunciation with a standing angel and a kneeling Virgin, slight and frail, who holds her open book to her breast.
./images/799.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Annunciation (Cell 3)	Fresco	This is the fresco on the wall of Cell 3 of the Convento di San Marco in Florence.On the left St Peter the Martyr is represented. This is a favourite theme, here simplified. A contribution of Angelico's pupils can be assumed.The composition of this fresco is severe in the extreme. The Virgin inhabits not a house but a cell as Spartan as that in which the fresco is painted, and beyond Gabriel and Mary the eye meets only a plain blank wall. The one piece of decoration, the capital of the column, is deliberately obscured by the wing of the angel. Here and throughout the series the pallet is extremely restrained, as if Angelico thought rich and varied colours were as likely as decoration to distract the friars from spiritual contemplation.
./images/800.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Nativity (Cell 5)	Fresco	This is the fresco on the wall of Cell 5 of the Convento di San Marco in Florence.The represented saints are St Catherine of Alexandria and St Peter the Martyr. It is partly attributed to the school of Fra Angelico.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 22 minutes):Thomas Tallis: Mass (Puer natus est)
./images/801.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Transfiguration (Cell 6)	Fresco	This is the fresco on the wall of Cell 6 of the Convento di San Marco in Florence.In this fresco Christ stands on a rock, prefiguring his rising from the tomb. His arms are outstretched and in this He also foreshadows his own crucifixion. He is voluminously clad in a sculptural mass of glowing white robe, and encircling Him is a radiant white mandorla. His forward gaze does not directly engage the eye of the spectator. At the base of the rock three of the Apostles crouch in awed positions, but they maintain the curious contemplative detachment from the drama of the scene which is the hallmark of this fresco cycle.At the edge of the fresco, on either side, stand the Virgin and St Dominic in positions indicative of prayer, stern and unresponsive to events around them. The heads of Moses and Elias appear beneath the arms of Christ; they are introduced as detached symbols to aid meditation. There is no attempt to create any more than the bare essentials of picture space; this particular spur to devotion required no more. For Angelico, too elaborate a spatial framework as much as excessive use of colour, decoration, or narrative, could detract from the picture's power.
./images/802.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Mocking of Christ (Cell 7)	Fresco	This is the fresco on the wall of Cell 7 of the Convento di San Marco in Florence.The contemplative restraint of the San Marco frescoes is nowhere better illustrated than in The Mocking of Christ. Rather than paint Christ's humiliations in their full violence in a complex narrative work, they are reduced to a series of iconographic symbols. In doing this Angelico was drawing on established trecento precedents.In a plain-walled room Christ sits on a dais in a luminous white robe and tunic. The great slab of white marble beneath Him adds to the air of radiant whiteness surrounding Him. He is blindfolded, with a crown of thorns about his head. Behind Him hanging from a plain frieze is a screen on which are painted the emblems of his indignities: the head of the spitting soldier, the hands of the buffeters, the hand and stick forcing the thorns down on his head. On a low step at the front of the picture sit the Virgin and St Dominic. Neither regard Christ but sit with their backs turned towards him in poses of intense meditation - the depth of meditation that the frescoes were designed to assist each friar to attain.Fra Angelico was assisted by Benozzo Gozzoli in the execution of this fresco.
./images/803.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Resurrection of Christ and Women at the Tomb (Cell 8)	Fresco	This is the fresco on the wall of Cell 8 of the Convento di San Marco in Florence.On the left, St Dominic in meditation. Thethree women on the rightwere painted by Benozzo Gozzoli who that time was an apprentice in the workshop of Fra Angelico. He collaborated in the pictorial decoration of the Dominican convent of San Marco.
./images/804.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Coronation of the Virgin (Cell 9)	Fresco	This is the fresco on the wall of Cell 9 of the Convento di San Marco in Florence.The glory of St Mary, a theme dear to Angelico is acclaimed by six kneeling saints. The saints represented on the lower part are (from the left) St Thomas, St Benedict, St Dominic, St Francis, St Peter the Martyr and St Mark. The fresco probably belongs to the first ones executed in the Convent by Fra Angelico.These six saints can be seen as a token representation of the elect, who surround Christ and the Virgin in heaven in the traditional rendering of this scene. But like so many other figures in the series of San Marco frescoes, they have an air of detachment from the events to which they are nominally witnesses. They hold their hands out in adoration and gaze heavenwards, but none looks directly at the scene of coronation. The Virgin, with her arms folded over her chest, leans forward to receive the crown. She is seated beside Christ, in accordance with the usual composition for this subject.In this series of frescoes at San Marco Angelico has not turned back to medieval prototypes but instead, through economy in the use of figures, restraint in the overt expression of emotion, and austere use of colour, he has created his own meditative images of remarkable force.
./images/805.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Presentation of Jesus in the Temple (Cell 10)	Fresco	This is the fresco on the wall of Cell 10 of the Convento di San Marco in Florence: St Peter Martyr and the Blessed Villana of the Dominican Order contemplate the three other figures of the Evangelical story.Along with his assistants, Fra Angelico decorated the vast convent of San Marco with frescoes. For the more public rooms, the painter produced rather festive and elaborate representations, but for the private cells where the paintings were the objects of the monks' contemplation, the frescoes were more spare and ethereal, painted with restrained colour.
./images/806.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Crucifixion with St Dominic (Cell 17)	Fresco	This is the fresco on the wall of Cell 17 of the Convento di San Marco in Florence.Over the course of the commission for decoration of the dormitory, Fra Angelico's direct participation in painting the frescoes seems to have diminished, while that of Benozzo Gozzoli and his other assistants increased. This is especially evident in the images of the Crucifixion with St Dominic in the novices' cells 17 an 20 of the south corridor, on which construction began in 1441. The frescoes were completed in only two days each. They seem to have been painted almost entirely by Benozzo Gozzoli, as is evident in the linear description of Christ's idealized anatomy, especially his ribcage, and the uninflected modelling of Dominic's habit.
./images/807.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Crucifixion with St Dominic Flagellating Himself (Cell 20)	Fresco	This is the fresco on the wall of Cell 20 of the Convento di San Marco in Florence.Over the course of the commission for decoration of the dormitory, Fra Angelico's direct participation in painting the frescoes seems to have diminished, while that of Benozzo Gozzoli and his other assistants increased.

./images/808.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Crucifixion with the Virgin, Mary Magdalene and St Dominic (Cell 25)	Fresco	This is the fresco on the wall of Cell 25 of the Convento di San Marco in Florence.Over the course of the commission for decoration of the dormitory, Fra Angelico's direct participation in painting the frescoes seems to have diminished, while that of Benozzo Gozzoli and his other assistants increased. This is especially evident in the images of the Crucifixion with St Dominic in the novices' cells 17 an 20 of the south corridor, which seem to have been painted almost entirely by Benozzo Gozzoli. Other artists seem to have executed several frescoes along the east corridor, as suggested by the somewhat awkward postures and gestures of the figures, the unmodulated contours and flat colours. An example of these can be seen in Cell 25.
./images/809.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Christ in Limbo (Cell 31)	Fresco	This is the fresco on the wall of Cell 31 of the Convento di San Marco in Florence.In contrast to most frescoes in the cells of the friars and novices, those in the corridor of the lay brethren are illustrative narratives that closely follow the Gospel of Matthew. These portrayals were directed to a community that was less attuned to theological and visual abstraction. Many of the scenes are situated in mountainous landscapes or detailed architectural settings. In Christ in Limbo, scaly demons hide in the rocky fissures of Purgatory while the faithful escape the darkness of Limbo to rush toward the resurrected Christ.The contribution of an assistant can be assumed in the execution of this fresco.
./images/810.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Institution of the Eucharist (Cell 35)	Fresco	This is the fresco on the wall of Cell 35 of the Convento di San Marco in Florence.In contrast to most frescoes in the cells of the friars and novices, those in the corridor of the lay brethren are illustrative narratives that closely follow the Gospel of Matthew. These portrayals were directed to a community that was less attuned to theological and visual abstraction. Many of the scenes are situated in mountainous landscapes or detailed architectural settings. The Institute of the Eucharist in Cell 35 underscored the Dominicans devotion to the Eucharist, which St Thomas articulated most eloquently in composing the office for the feast of Corpus Domini. It transpires in a spacious room similar to the convent's actual refectory and repeats elements of San Marco's own architecture - the arched windows of the dormitory, the well in the second cloister - to emphasize its relevance to the lay brother.This fresco was executed by an assistant of Fra Angelico.
./images/811.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Nailing of Christ to the Cross (Cell 36)	Fresco	This is the fresco on the wall of Cell 36 of the Convento di San Marco in Florence.The Crucifixion is depicted in seven cells in the corridor for lay brothers. While the friars and novices may have been moved to prayer at the thought or sight of the crucified Christ, the lay brothers required more direction in imagining the Passion. By incorporating more narrative elements, these images were able to prompt their devotion more efficaciously. In Cell 36, Roman soldiers mount ladders to nail Christ to the cross, below which the grieving Virgin and Magdalene stand as Sanhedrin look on.The contribution of an assistant can be assumed in the execution of this fresco.
./images/812.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Crucifixion with Mourners and Sts Dominic and Thomas Aquinas (Cell 37)	Fresco	This is the fresco on the wall of Cell 37 of the Convento di San Marco in Florence.The Crucifixion is depicted in seven cells in the corridor for lay brothers. While the friars and novices may have been moved to prayer at the thought or sight of the crucified Christ, the lay brothers required more direction in imagining the Passion. By incorporating more narrative elements, these images were able to prompt their devotion more efficaciously. In six cells Fra Angelico included the grieving Virgin and other mourners along with St Dominic or Peter martyr to cue the beholder's response. So it was in Cell 37, the large size of which suggests it may have served as the Chapter Room for the lay brothers as they met each day under the guidance of their own prior.The contribution of an assistant can be assumed in the execution of this fresco.
./images/813.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Crucifixion with the Virgin and Sts Cosmas, John the Evangelist and Peter Martyr (Cell 38)	Fresco	This is the fresco on the wall of Cell 38 of the Convento di San Marco in Florence.One cell at the end of the corridor for lay brothers was distinguished by its occupant and size. It was intended for Cosimo de' Medici, who belonged to the community by virtue of his patronage. His room, in fact, was a double cell (Cells 38 and 39), in which the superimposed chambers were joined by a short flight of stairs. Of all the cells along this corridor, Cosimo's was the most spacious and elaborately decorated. On the entrance wall of the lower room (Cell 38) Fra Angelico painted the crucified Christ against a ground of costly lapis lazuli, rather than the bare plaster background found in the other cells. The inscribed haloes identify the saints kneeling alongside the Virgin as Cosmas, Peter martyr and John the Evangelist, protectors of Cosimo, his oldest son, and his father, Giovanni di Bicci.The Adoration of the Magi and the image of Christ as Man of Sorrows in the recessed tabernacle below met Cosimo's gaze once he ascended the stairs to Cell 39. Benozzo Gozzoli, whose style closely resembled that of Angelico, and an assistant painted these frescoes, as shown by the slightly awkward stance and proportions of some of the figures as well as by their linear, closely spaced facial features.

./images/815.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Corridor of the North Dormitory	-	The Medici chose the rising architect, Michelozzo di Bartolomeo to rebuild San Marco. The restoration proceeded with remarkable speed. The twenty cells of the east corridor of the dormitory were built between late 1437 and 1438, when renovation of the church was begun. Reconstruction continued sequentially, from the north corridor for lay brothers and guests (1440-41) to the south for the novices (completed in 1442).
./images/816.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	The Annunciation	Fresco	This fresco is situated on the wall of the northern corridor on the upper floor in front of the staircase in the Convento di San Marco in Florence. It was painted on Angelico's return from Rome in 1450, and is therefore several years later than the majority of the frescoes at San Marco. In style it falls between the sparseness of The Annunciation in cell 3 and the richness of the Cortona altarpiece. Unlike in the Cortona version, the garden is here viewed through a colonnade of columns which recede to a vanishing point near the centre of the painting.Under the arches between the Corinthian columns are the slender figures of the Madonna and of the angel in devout converse, regulated with the rhythm of gentle curves; in the background, on the left, the celestial fields with Tuscan cypresses; Gabriel's wings stretch out like a rainbow. It is the theme of the tabernacles which multiply themselves at the crossing of the ways; the greeting taken from the mediaeval hymnology and the invitation addressed to the passer-by and writings under the painting show Angelico's most cultivated devotion: Salve, Mater pietatis / et totius Trinitatis / nobile triclinium / Maria!The lighting of the scene is curiously illogical, the interior of the arcaded loggia is evenly illuminated, despite the fairly strong light coming from the left.

./images/819.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Crucifixion and Saints	Fresco	The giant fresco occupies the entire wall opposite to the entrance of the Chapter Room. The saints depicted are, from the left: Cosmas and Damian, Lawrence, Mark the Evangelist, John the Baptist, the Virgin and the pious women; to the right of the Cricifixion kneeling Dominic, Jerome, Francis, Bernard, John Gualberto and Peter the Martyr, standing Zanobi (or perhaps Ambrose), Augustin, Benedict, Romuald and Thomas of Aquino. Around the fresco, on the border, are the busts of the Prophets and Sibyls in ten hexagons; in the centre, above the Crucifixion the pelikan, symbol of the redemption. Below, in the lower frieze there are 17 medallions with portraits of the most illustrious members of the Dominican Order.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 3 minutes):Guillaume Dufay: Hymn for Easter

./images/824.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Sacra Conversazione	Fresco	This fresco on the wall of the east corridor of the convent is also called Madonna of the Shadows (Madonna delle Ombre).Painted in the corridor off which the brethren's cells open (between cells 25 and 26), this fresco was one of Fra Angelico's last works in San Marco's Dominican Monastery. There is almost a metaphysical feel to the frozen gestures, the deep gazes, and the strong and boldly-applied colours. This sensation is boosted by the power of the side-lighting, which in turn is emphasized by the long shadows cast by the classical capitals. These are reminiscent of architecture by Michelozzo. This fresco is the painter's ultimate achievement of wonderful synthesis between his mystical inspiration and the effective application of recent breakthroughs in Renaissance painting.
./images/825.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Sacra Conversazione (detail)	Fresco	"The picture shows the left side of the Madonna of the Shadows. On the left, St Dominic engages the beholder's gaze, directing it to his book. The text, which has no known source in his writings, is an exhortation to the friars: ""Have charity, preserve humility, possess voluntary poverty. I call forth God's curse and mine on the introduction of possessions into this Order."" St Dominic stands at a distance from St Mark, as well as from Sts Cosmas and Damian to whom the convent was jointly dedicated."

./images/828.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	View of the Convent of San Marco	-	The Museum of San Marco is located in the former monastery of the Dominicans, constructed by Michelozzo in 1436 on a commission from the Medici ruler Cosimo the Elder. Michelozzo here adheres firmly to the Renaissance forms of Brunelleschi, even though his classicism has none of the other's passion for archeological research in it. The smooth, flowing lines of the cloister's arches create effects of light and shade which alternate in the series of vaults. Naturally the religious function and the deliberately spiritual effect of the structure, suggested by the order's Vicar General and perhaps by Fra Angelico himself, qualify these chiaroscuro and plastic impressions. The history of San Marco is inseparably linked to the figures of the painters, Fra Angelico and Fra Bartolommeo, and the friar Girolamo Savonarola.The figure of Angelico dominates in the Convent.  The friar painter lived a long time here and expressed here his delicate and simple soul in the sincere, candid forms of art. But a great part, not only the artistic, but of the religious and civil history of Florence developed here.In the cloisters, in the dormitories, in the cells we find the conventual character well-preserved in the harmonious architectural plan. We also find the memory of San Antonino, who entered here as a friar, and, it is said on the advice of Angelico, came out of it in 1445 archbishop of Florence; and the memory of Savonarola, who came here in 1489, and was later prior of the convent and who from here raised himself against the decadence of habits calling the people to liberty and democratic arrangement; and the memory, above that of Angelico's almost unknown collaborators, of a great friar painter, Fra Bartolommeo.
./images/830.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	St Peter Martyr	Fresco	This fresco, generally attributed to Fra Angelico is located in the lunette above the entrance to the church of the Convent.
./images/833.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	View of the chapel	Fresco	This view shows the window (west) and entry (north) walls of the chapel decorated by Fra Angelico. The fresco cycle consists of scenes from the lives of the archdeacons Stephen (lunette) and Lawrence (bottom register).On either side of the scenes on the west (and similarly on the east) wall there is a narrow panel containing only a single figure. These panels are actually on the inner face of the arches at the end of these walls. There eight full-length figures of saints painted on the arches. (In this view St Ambrose and, below him, St Thomas Aquinas is shown.) The chapel's wainscoting section, roughly 2,5 meters high, is painted with a wall drapery in a pomegranate design against a red background. In two spots the coat-of-arms of Pope Nicholas V appears inside a laurel wreath. The deep embrasures of the two windows present six- and seven-lobed rosettes containing alternating floral designs and portrait busts prophets and saints.
./images/834.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	West wall of the chapel	Fresco	The fresco cycle consists of scenes from the lives of the archdeacons Stephen (lunette) and Lawrence (bottom register).On the lunette of the west wall, St Peter, prince of the apostles, is anointing St Stephen, deacon of the church. In the smaller compartment of the lower register, between the two windows, St Sixtus is seen bestowing the same office on St Lawrence. This lunette presents a second scene of St Stephen distributing alms to the poor. The corresponding motif from the life of St Lawrence appears in the right-hand picture compartment of the north wall, above the entry.There are also two original windows on the west wall.
./images/835.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Lunette of the west wall	Fresco	The lunette represents two scenes: St Peter Consacrates Stephen as Deacon; St Stephen Distributing Alms.
./images/836.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	St Peter Consacrates Stephen as Deacon	Fresco	This scene is the left part of the lunette on the west wall.
./images/838.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	St Stephen Distributing Alms	Fresco	This scene is the right part of the lunette on the west wall.
./images/840.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	St Peter Consacrates St Lawrence as Deacon	Fresco	Sixtus II (257-258) had charged archdeacon Lawrence with dispersing the church's wealth to the needy. This deed aroused the ire of Emperor Valerian who had claimed the treasure for himself, and formed the basis for the charges brought against Lawrence and his eventual execution.In its setting in the Chapel of Pope Nicholas V in the Vatican, the dramatic impact of this fresco is aided by its position between two recessed windows. The scene is set in the nave of a basilica, the type of architectural space which in St Lawrence distributing Alms was used only as a backdrop. Five columns are visible on either side, and they are equalled in volume and monumentality by the bishops and other churchmen who witness St Lawrence kneeling before the Pope. The end wall of the basilica and its niche bring emphasis to no figure in the composition, for none stands at the centre. The central axis runs instead through the communion chalice which passes between the Pope and the saint.It is remarkable that in this fresco cycle the pope and the prelates wear azure vests, then rarely used and presently non-existent.
./images/841.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	North wall of the chapel	Fresco	The fresco cycle consists of scenes from the lives of the archdeacons Stephen (lunette) and Lawrence (bottom register).On the lunette of the north wall, St Stephen is seen preaching on the left, and on the right engaged in the dispute with the Jews that led to his condemnation. In the bottom register, St Sixtus is entrusting the church treasure to St Lawrence (left) and St Lawrence distributing alms (right, above the entrance door).
./images/842.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Lunette of the north wall	Fresco	The lunette represents two scenes: The Sermon of St Stephen; Dispute before the Sanhedrin.On the left St Stephen preaches to an array of figures placed throughout the vista of space. To the right, in a chamber which is also embedded in the lefthand scene yet has a different perspective framework, he addresses the council. Here the depth of the picture is truncated by a blank wall hung with a curtain.
./images/843.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	The Sermon of St Stephen	Fresco	This scene is the left part of the lunette on the north wall.
./images/844.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Dispute before Sanhedrin	Fresco	This scene is the right part of the lunette on the north wall.
./images/845.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Scenes on the north wall	Fresco	Below the lunette two scenes are represented: St Sixtus Entrusts the Church Treasures to Lawrence; St Lawrence Distributing Alms.St Lawrence, a third-century Roman who, like St Stephen, suffered a violent death for his faith, was venerated as one of the most famous martyrs of the city of Rome. This fresco panel is divided in two, without any attempt to give the neighbouring scenes any architectural or spatial cohesion. The architecture employed by Angelico in both scenes is of a distinctly Roman splendour and dignity. The two events from the life of the saint are simply told. They are rich in detail but none is superfluous to the narrative.On the left he kneels to receive the treasures of the Church from Pope St Sixtus II, who is given the features of Angelico's patron, Nicholas V. It has been suggested that the depiction of the two soldiers preparing to break open a bricked-up door, is a reference to Pope Nicholas's decision to declare 1450 a Jubilee Year.On the right, St Lawrence is shown framed in the entrance to a colonnaded basilica of great monumentality. The distant apse further frames and gives emphasis to the saint. He is attended by the poor, blind and lame, and hands money to a legless man in the immediate foreground. His scarlet vestment is scattered with golden flames and hints at his future death by burning.
./images/846.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	St Sixtus Entrusts the Church Treasures to Lawrence	Fresco	In 1447, or perhaps earlier, Fra Angelico was in Rome, where he painted the private chapel of Pope Nicholas V with scenes from the lives of St Lawrence and St Stephen, frescoes which sum up the whole trend of his work. They possess a logical realism in their perspective settings, clarity of scale and narrative content, and restraint in their vigour. The colour is limpid, but with sufficient use of chiaroscuro to give substance to the figures; the use of continuous  representation is kept to a minimum by the division of the scenes through differences in their architectural setting, but nowhere is the search for realism in the use of lighting effects allowed to destroy the unity of the whole, or the sense of the plane of the wall.The stories are told with a wealth of circumstantial  and colourful detail: for instance the allusion to the Pope's decision to declare 1450 a Jubilee Year is shown by the two soldiers about to break down  the walled-up door on the left but even a detail of this kind is never intrusive or merely included for decorative richness, but is at the heart of the narrative.
./images/849.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	St Lawrence Distributing Alms	Fresco	Fra Angelico's delicate vision appears to have been a bit overwhelmed by the vastness and imposing scale of Rome and its monuments. In order to become more consistent with the most modern style that was then the vogue in Rome, Fra Angelico attempted to imbue his scenes with Roman monumental classicism.This fresco was erraneously attributed to Benozzo Gozzoli. However, it is a work by Fra Angelico with coworkers.
./images/851.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Scenes from the Lives of Sts Lawrence and Stephen	Fresco	"Fra Angelico was entrusted with a number of commissions for the Vatican Palace. The one that involved the most work was the decoration of the small room in the ancient tower of Pope Innocent III that Nicholas V turned into his private chapel, a rectangular space with a groin vault. The floor installed at this time survives. It displays the emblem of Nicholas V, a radiant sun. The frescoes show scenes from the lives of Sts Stephen and Lawrence, in two horizontal bands. On the rear wall was a Deposition, also by Fra Angelico and mentioned by Vasari, but now lost. On the arches are the eight Doctors of the Church in Gothic aedicules. The Evangelists are on the vault, while on the window jambs rosettes with the head of Christ alternate with heads of patriarchs and prophets.The cycle is generally attributed to Fra Angelico and his workshop. The hand of Benozzo Gozzoli has been identified in some of the scenes from the life of St Stephen. Painted for the jubilee of 1450, the cycle clearly reveals the program pursued by Nicholas V of a link between Christian and classical culture. Fra Angelico's figures have a ""Roman"" appearance: they stand solemn and serious, like heroes from antiquity, against a background of theatrical architecture, reminding the beholder of the buildings of ancient Rome. The intention was to underline the continuity between imperial and Christian Rome which the pope wished to assert."
./images/852.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	East wall of the chapel	Fresco	The fresco cycle consists of scenes from the lives of the archdeacons Stephen (lunette) and Lawrence (bottom register).On the east wall the narratives run parallel. To the left in the lunette St Stephen is being led to his martyrdom, and to the right we see him being stoned to death. In the lower register Lawrence is first condemned by Emperor Valerian, then in the adjacent scene he is martyred by being roasted on a gridiron. Between these is an auxiliary motif, seen through a small window, showing the conversion of St Hyppolitus, the chief jailer.
./images/853.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Lunette of the east wall	Fresco	The lunette represents two scenes: St Stephen being led to His Martyrdom; Stoning of St Stephen.Stephen had been blessed by the Apostles and was the first to be ordained as deacon. Accused of blasphemy, he was stoned to death in Jerusalem. According to legend his remains were taken to Rome in the fifth century and buried beside those of St Lawrence.This lunette is divided in two by the monumental city wall which forms a natural part of both the scenes portrayed. The soft hills strewn with collections of towers and houses are in Angelico's familiar landscape style. All lit from the same source, the lunette has a complete spatial unity.On the left St Stephen, having incurred the wrath of the council, is dragged to the city gate and meets his fate outside it as the first Christian martyr. On the right he is portrayed at prayer. Around him are the stones which have bloodied his face; two more bounce off the back of his head; one of his executioners raises another one high, about to strike again, and holds more in his robe. Saul, who was a consenting witness to the execution, is shown, following the details given in the Acts of the Apostles, as a young man holding part of Stephen's clothes which had been laid at his feet by the witnesses.
./images/854.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	St Stephen Being Led to his Martyrdom	Fresco	This scene is the left half the lunette on the east wall.
./images/855.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	The Stoning of St Stephen	Fresco	This scene is the right half the lunette on the east wall. The left half depicts St Stephen being led to his martyrdom.In this scene he is portrayed at prayer following the description that 'he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge.' (Apostles 8, v. 60). Around him are the stones which have bloodied his face; two more bounce off the back of his head; one of his executioners raises another one high, about to strike again, and holds more in his robe. Saul, who was a consenting witness to the execution, is shown, following the details given in the Acts of the Apostles, as a young man holding part of Stephen's clothes which had been laid at his feet by the witnesses.
./images/857.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Condemnation of St Lawrence by the Emperor Valerian	Fresco	This scene is the left half the fresco below the lunette on the east wall. The right half depicts the martyrdom of St Lawrence. The two are linked by the cornice which, although it changes in its detailing, is essentially common to both scenes.The composition of Condemnation of St Lawrence by the Emperor Valerian owes much to Angelico's earlier sacra conversazione. The wall broken into sections by pilasters, hung with a rich ornamental curtain and incorporating a lofty architectural throne, is familiar from the Annalena altarpiece of a couple of years before. Various soldiers and city worthies stand in a circle before the Emperor, helping to create a sense of depth without the assistance of any converging orthogonals in the foreground.
./images/859.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Martyrdom of St Lawrence	Fresco	This scene is the right compartment of the bottom register.
./images/860.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	View of the chapel vaulting	Fresco	Following convention, the four evangelists appear in the ceiling's cross-ribbed vaulting against a starry sky. Drawings survive for the St Mark and St Matthew (MusÃ©e CondÃ©, Chantilly, Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge), considered to be works by Benozzo Gozzoli.
./images/861.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	View of the chapel vaulting	Fresco	In the vaults of the chapel, the Evangelists are suspended on clouds, amid the starry blue heavens. Their luminous faces and pale garments seem suffused with incandescent light as they compose the Gospels of Christ's life.

./images/868.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Mystic Wheel (The Vision of Ezekiel)	Tempera on panel	This panel is part of a series, now consisting of thirty-five panels, commissioned by Piero de Medici for the doors of a cupboard at the San Marco convent, and depicting scenes from the life of Christ.In this, the first panel, the prophet Ezekiel and St Gregory the Great sit in a mountainous landscape with the river Chobar running between them. In the top left of the panel is a text from the first book of Ezekiel outlining the prophet's vision, which is shown below. Ezekiel leans back, his hands raised in surprise. His vision included four animalia who, 'had one likeness: and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel', (Ezekiel 1, v. 16). It is this wheel within a wheel which is shown here with a flaming circumference. Angelico depicts the wheel as being made of two concentric circles. Around the larger wheel is the account of the creation from Genesis, and around the smaller the first three verses of the Gospel of St. John, 'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the word was God ...', which echo the words from Genesis.At the top right of the picture is an excerpt from the writings of St Gregory, who interpreted the prophet's vision and used it to emphasize parallels between the Old and New Testaments. The theme of parallels between the two Testaments is pursued through all the other panels in the series.
./images/869.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Annunciation	Tempera on wood	Although the themes and settings of the scenes are varied, Angelico united the ensemble with consistently scaled figures, architecture and horizons. The Annunciation takes place within a deep, open courtyard framed by twin porticos, inspired by the architecture of the church.Throughout the cycle, parallel and prophetic texts amplify the resonance of every scene. In the Annunciation, the quotations from the Book of Isaiah and the Gospel of Luke are virtually identical in phrasing, confirming, according to Christian exegesis, that Isaiah's prophecy was fulfilled through the Incarnation and divinely ordered.
./images/870.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Flight into Egypt	Tempera on wood	This scene shows the continuing influence on Angelico of naturalism. Having been warned in a dream, Joseph, Mary and the infant Christ make their escape from Herod's massacres by going into Egypt. Behind them a series of trees of diminishing size plots out the perspective of the landscape. The Holy Family is lit by a strong light from the left, the Virgin's draperies carefully delineated so as to show the position of both her legs as she rides side-saddle on the donkey. As in The Circumcision her halo is depicted as a three-dimensional object, which can both turn in space and reflect light. It was only late in his career as a painter that Angelico began to develop the spatial properties of the nimbus.
./images/871.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Massacre of the Innocents	Tempera on wood	Herod, with crown and sceptre, watches from above the infanticide he has ordained. The sinister, dark-clad soldiers pour through the archway wielding black daggers against the children. The mothers, shown in a great variety of terrified postures and with looks of horror, attempt to protect their infants, but to no avail.
./images/873.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Circumcision	Tempera on wood	In the Temple, Christ is presented for circumcision. The table takes centre stage and its receding top leads the eye back to the choir. The forms of the three figures in the foreground are echoed in the background by the three arched walls of the choir and their windows. The chiefly vertical fall of the draperies of all the figures is painted with great discrimination, and echoes the fluting of the pilasters.
./images/874.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Annunciation and Adoration of the Magi	Tempera and gold on panel	The superimposed scenes are portrayed on a golden ground, the elaborately tooled patterns and rich array of colours of which seem inspired by the exquisite textiles and chromatic brilliance ofGentile da Fabriano's altarpiece.
./images/875.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Madonna of the Star	Tempera and gold on panel	The Madonna of the Star portrays the Virgin holding the Child on an incised, golden radiance as she embraces him tenderly. The image of the standing Virgin and Child emerged from a rich biblical and visual tradition exemplified in amarble statue by Nino Pisanoin the Santa Maria Novella.
./images/876.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	St Peter Martyr Altarpiece	Tempera and gold on panel	In this early altarpiece by Fra Angelico the Virgin and Child are in the centre, while Sts Dominic and John the Baptist are represented on the left and Sts Peter Martyr and Thomas Aquinas on the right. On the upper part scenes from the life of St Peter Martyr are depicted.
./images/878.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Predella of the St Peter Martyr Altarpiece (detail)	Tempera and gold on panel	The predella (now separated) of the St Peter Martyr Altarpiece depicts the Dead Christ with six saints, five of whom female. It was addressed specifically to the sisters who knelt before it in prayer. The holy women on the predella served as models for the piety of the sisters.

./images/881.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Compagnia di San Francesco Altarpiece	Tempera and gold on panel	The altarpiece Madonna and Child with Saints Jerome, John the Baptist, Francis and Onophrius is known as the Compagnia di San Francesco Altarpiece.Fra Angelico's renown extended beyond the congregations of his Order. In accord with the mission of Saint Dominic to evangelize, the friar expressed the lessons of his faith for numerous clients. Documents demonstrate that a range of patrons sought his work throughout the 1420s. In 1429, the penitential confraternity of San Francesco, which met in the cloister of Santa Croce, paid Fra Angelico ('frate Guido') for its altarpiece. Though the altarpiece was cut apart at some point in its history, its components have been identified. The central and lateral panels are in the Museo di San Marco, Florence, while the predella panels are dispersed in various collections.
./images/882.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Trial by Fire	Tempera on wood	This painting was part of the predella which belonged to a triptych of the Madonna and Child with Four Saints (known as the Compagnia di San Francesco Altarpiece), commissioned for the convent of Santa Croce in Florence 1429. The five predella panels depicting scenes from the life of St Francis of Assisi are the following:1. Trial by Fire (Lindenau-Museum, Altenburg)2. Receiving the Stigmata (Pinacoteca Vaticana, Rome)3. Meeting of St Francis and St Dominic (Staatliche Museen, Berlin)4. Apparition of St Francis at Arles (Staatliche Museen, Berlin)5. Lamentation over St Francis (Staatliche Museen, Berlin)

Lamentation over St Francis (Staatliche Museen, Berlin)Among the predella panels, the Apparition of St Francis at Arles is especially remarkable for its deep architectural setting, its luminary effects and its atmospheric perspective.

./images/888.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Coronation of the Virgin	Tempera on panel	This altarpiece, exhibited now in the MusÃ©e du Louvre together with its seven predella pictures, was executed for the church San Domenico in Fiesole, and it is one of the most famous of Fra Angelico's works. It is a good example of the painter's art of tempera painting with fresh colours that have not changed. On the predella the story of San Domenico is depicted.In this altarpiece Fra Angelico departs markedly from his usual methods of space projection, but this can be explained by the extreme difficulty of integrating so complex a composition as a traditional Coronation, into the type of space he had recently employed. The whole, although still a heavenly scene, is set on terra firma. The sky is a realistic blue and not gold. The very low view-point enables the assembled saints and angels to be placed in a series of tiers without obscuring one another. The figures in the foreground kneel so as not to attract undue emphasis. Mary Magdalen holds out her jar of oil, marking the central axis.Recently a date of 1450, which is considered compatible with the internal dating evidence of this altarpiece, is suggested.
./images/889.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Coronation of the Virgin (detail)	Tempera on panel	St Nicholas of Bari is shown kneeling in the foreground of The Coronation of the Virgin with his episcopal mitre and crook. St Nicholas's cope shows several scenes from the Passion, including the Betrayal, Mocking, and Flagellation. To his left are St Anthony and St Francis of Assisi.
./images/890.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Coronation of the Virgin (detail)	Tempera on panel	St Catherine of Alexandria stands holding her wheel and regarding St Agnes, who clutches her own symbol, a lamb. St Agnes's robe falls in heavy sculptured loops to the ground. The haloes of the two saints are carefully arranged so that St Catherine's face is not obscured. The haloes in this painting are treated very flatly but in some cases also extremely decoratively, being studded with gems.
./images/891.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	The Coronation of the Virgin	Tempera on wood	Fra Angelico dedicated several of his works to the scene of Mary's coronation (Louvre, Paris; Museo di San Marco, Florence, Uffizi, Florence). In these pictures the ceremoniousness of the event is lessened by the gentle charm of the details.This painting is from the church of Sant'Egidio of Ospedale di Santa Maria Nuova in Florence. Its approach is special in that it presents the scene in the sky, floating on clouds, thus placing Jesus and Mary and their surrounding entourage in an interesting perspective. Spatial relations are illustrated by the use of size differences, the virtuoso rendering of light-rays, and colour perspective.The angelic choir greets the Queen of Heavens with song and dance. In the right foreground, with his back to the viewer, an angel dressed in blue plays the portative organ; his companion to the left a stringed instrument. Above, on both sides of the main group, the trumpets are raised high above the heads. Among the other instruments we can recognize a beautiful lute on the left, and a small oval-shaped violin (or mandola) on the right. The inner ring is composed of six tall, dancing angels; their flowing robes and the position of their hands indicate the direction of their movement.
./images/893.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Marriage of the Virgin	Tempera and gold on panel	The picture shows one of the predella panels of the Coronation of the Virgin.The Coronation of the Virgin was painted by Fra Angelico for the church of the hospital of Santa Maria Nuova. Although the original frame of the altarpiece is lost, the two panels that formed its predella have been identified. They represent the Marriage of the Virgin, which theologians regarded as a prefiguration of the Coronation, and the Dormition of the Virgin, which immediately precedes the Coronation. Each scene displays Angelico's command of perspective, nuanced portrayal of emotion and radiant colour.
./images/894.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Dormition of the Virgin	Tempera and gold on panel	The picture shows one of the predella panels of the Coronation of the Virgin.The Coronation of the Virgin was painted by Fra Angelico for the church of the hospital of Santa Maria Nuova. Although the original frame of the altarpiece is lost, the two panels that formed its predella have been identified.

Each scene displays Angelico's command of perspective, nuanced portrayal of emotion and radiant colour.
./images/895.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Annunciation	Panel	The attribution and the datation of this painting was long debated. However, after a successful restoration it is today appreciated as one of the painter's masterpieces. The artist returned time after time to his favourite theme of the angel bringing the news and the devout Mary in a posture of humble acceptance.The size of the main panel is 149 x 158 cm, while the five predella panels, representing five scenes of the life of the Virgin (the Marriage of the Virgin, the Visitation, the Adoration of the Magi, the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple, and the Funeral of the Virgin), have the size of 17 x 26 cm each.
./images/896.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Annalena Altarpiece (without predella)	Tempera and gold on panel	The painting got the name from its original location, the Convento di San Vincenzo d'Annalena, founded by Annalena Malatesta.This is Angelico's second sacra conversazione, and shares many elements in common with its forerunner, the San Marco altarpiece. Unlike the San Marco altarpiece, however, there are no angels here and the Virgin and Child are in the company only of Sts Peter Martyr, Cosmas, Damian, John the Evangelist, Lawrence and Francis. Although they have left their individual panels, never to return, there is still an echo of these in the blank arches of the wall which closes the back of the picture.The high wall and its pink cornice run the full width of the panel. The natural world, which was the setting of the first altarpiece, is now confined to the grass and flowers at the very front of the picture. There is no carpet on the ground here and the foreground is much shallower than in the earlier work. The method of space projection remains basically the same and relies on the receding rectangles of the steps to the throne and of its cornice. An element common to both altarpieces is the use of a carpet running across the back of the picture parallel to the picture plane.
./images/897.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Annalena Altarpiece	Tempera and gold on panel	Although the original location of this altarpiece is the Convento di San Vincenzo d'Annalena, it seems to have been painted for the double chapel of the Medici family, dedicated to Sts Cosmas and Damian and located on the south transept of San Lorenzo, Florence. In the mid-1430s, San Lorenzo was still under construction. The represented saints on the altarpiece are the patron saints of the male members of the Medici dynasty, and the predella (executed by Zanobi Strozzi) contains scenes from the life of Sts Cosmas and Damian.
./images/898.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Annalena Altarpiece (detail)	Tempera and gold on panel	In the rhythmic treatment of the architectural elements, Fra Angelico inserts figures that will later serve as the starting point for his most gifted pupil, Benozzo Gozzoli.
./images/899.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Bosco ai Frati Altarpiece	Tempera and gold on panel	This altarpiece was painted by Angelico after his return from Rome for the Franciscan convent of Bosco ai Frati in Mugello. It was probably commissioned by Cosimo de' Medici who started the renovation of the convent in 1438. The altarpiece represents the Virgin and Child enthroned with two angels, and Sts Anthony of Padua, Louis of Toulouse and Francis (on the left), as well as Sts Cosmas, Damian and Peter Martyr (on the right).The altarpiece shows further developments of the formula that underlies his earlier sacra conversazione. The architecture is richer and more plastic, so that its articulation of the picture space is partly camouflaged. The throne has been widened and heightened, now looking like the apse of a small church, bringing greater emphasis to the Virgin and Child at the expense of the saints. The wall is enlivened by a series of recessions and projections in the form of niches and half ionic columns. Although the grass and flowers have been excluded from the foreground, the natural world reasserts itself, albeit in a symmetrical composition, behind the wall.

./images/902.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Triptych: The Last Judgment	Poplar	Fra Angelico's late Last Judgment is close to Trecento sources, to the school of Orcagna in particular. It was painted when the popular artist had a large studio. Perhaps the painting is by Zanubi Strozzi, who was predominantly a manuscript illuminator. Originally on a single panel, the scene was cut into thirds at a much later date.
./images/903.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Adoration of the Magi	Tempera and gold on panel	The austerity of this painting seems a reinterpretation of Gentile da Fabriano'smagnificent altarpiecethat focuses on the solemnity of Epiphany rather than the splendour of the Magi's entourage or the richness of their garments.
./images/904.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Crucifixion with the Virgin, John the Evangelist, and Mary Magdelene	Tempera and gold on panel	The slender anatomy of Christ, the taut contours shadowed against the gold ground and the windblown loincloth are related closely to the Crucifixions by Lorenzo Monaco and his workshop, as is the foreshortening of his head, lowered in death. While derived from Lorenzo's portrayals, Angelico's interpretation is stylistically different, best expressed in the figures of the mourners below the Cross. The artist created the illusion of depth by varying the angles at which they are portrayed and through perspective.
./images/905.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Madonna of Humility	Tempera and gold on panel	Fra Angelico's earliest paintings are generally dated in the early 1420s. However, it seems likely that several were executed before the 1420s, for they interpret themes associated with Lorenzo Monaco in a style and sensibility closely related to that of the master. They may be attributed to Angelico because of their analogies to paintings from the 1420s known to be by him. A crucial painting for understanding this early period is the Madonna of Humility in St. Petersburg.The theme of the Madonna of Humility originated  in the mid-fourteenth century and surged in popularity through the first few decades of the fifteenth century. It was portrayed time and again by Lorenzo Monaco and his workshop. It shows the Virgin, humbly seated on the ground instead of majestically enthroned, tenderly holding the infant Jesus on her lap. The attribution of this Madonna to Angelico is substantiated by a comparison with thecentral panelof the San Domenico di Fiesole Altarpiece.
./images/906.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Madonna of Humility	Tempera and gold on panel	This painting formed the central panel of a dismembered altarpiece and is enclosed in its original frame. It was commissioned by the illustrious Florentine Giugni family. The patronage by so prominent a family indicates the professional stature the painter had achieved at this time. The panel was inspired by the paintings of this theme by Lorenzo Monaco and his workshop.
./images/907.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Madonna and Child	Poplar	This humble image by Fra Angelico approaches the new lyricism of Ghiberti, Quercia, and Masolino. Though Fra Angelico has adopted the fourteenth-century devotional formula for his Madonna, with Mary seated close to the ground, he cannot help investing her with a richly tasseled pillow and a lavishly brocaded cloth of honour. Sts Dominic and Peter Martyr are tucked in at the left and right.
./images/908.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Crucifixion	Tempera and gold on panel	This panel, probably the centre part of a triptych or a wing of a diptych, was formerly attributed to Giovanni Toscani (d. 1430), a follower of Masaccio and Masolino. Recent reconsideration of the attribution gave the painting to the young Fra Angelico.
./images/909.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Madonna and Child of the Grapes	Tempera and gold on panel	This panel was inspired by theMadonna and Child with Saint Anneby Masaccio and Masolino.
./images/910.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Penitent St Jerome	Tempera and gold on panel	The family coat-of-arms of the donors, Agnolo di Zanobi Gaddi, descendant of the painters Agnolo and Taddeo Gaddi, and his wife, Maddalena NiccolÃ² Ridolfi, are painted on the lower corners of the panel.
./images/911.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Reliquary Tabernacle	Tempera and gold on panel	This panel was one of the four reliquaries that Fra Angelico made for the Dominican church of Santa Maria Novella, Florence. The other three are in the Museo di San Marco, Florence.This panel is divided into two sections: below, the Virgin Mary's obsequies are coming to an end, and above is her Assumption into heaven. In the lower register Christ has come to collect the Virgin Mary's soul, which he holds in the form of a small child.
./images/912.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Virgin and Child Enthroned with Twelve Angels	Tempera on panel	Here Angelico shows an increasing command of space and an equal interest in its depiction. He has added a carefully rendered, elegant throne raised over three steps, which fills the greater part of the panel and produces a bold spatial statement. Its top takes the form of a hexagonal cupola, but this still has chiefly pointed arches and cannot be said to represent the architectural avant-garde of the time. Compared with his later depictions of architecture it lacks monumentality. There is no attempt to extend the picture space into the far distance or to heighten the realism further, as the background of the panel is rendered in plain gold in the trecento fashion.
./images/913.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Archangel Gabriel Annunciate	Tempera and gold on panel	Two panels in Detroit represent the Annunciation at the moment when the angel Gabriel greets the Virgin. She responds in a gesture of humble acceptance, crossing her arms over her chest. In her right hand she holds a small red bound book. She has marked the place by her finger.The original provenance and function of these two panels is uncertain. Though they are clearly fragments, it has never been ascertained whether they had been  cut out of a larger composition, were the subsidiary part of an altarpiece, or constituted the wings of a diptych

./images/915.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Virgin and Child with Sts Dominic and Catherine of Alexandria	Tempera with gilding on wood	This small high quality panel shows the Virgin in glory between two groups of praying angels. She is worshipped by Saint Dominic and Saint Catherine of Alexandria, who appear on a smaller scale at the sides of the throne. The former, wearing the Dominican habit, holds a lily in one hand, and in the other the book of the Constitutions of the Order of Preachers (Dominicans); the latter, recognizable by her attribute, the wheel, holds the martyr's palm between her hands. The holy child, standing on his mother's lap, strokes her cheek with his right hand while she holds him close, and in her free hand she holds a white rose.The early provenance of the panel is not known.
./images/917.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	The Apostle St James the Great Freeing the Magician Hermogenes	Tempera and gold on panel	There are four panels in various collections which belonged originally to the predella of an unidentified altarpiece. The panels illustrate stories from the legends of the Virgin Mary, the apostle St James the Great, St John the Baptist, and Sts Francis and Dominic. The scenes are the following: The Apostle St James the Great Freeing the Magician Hermogenes; The Naming of St John the Baptist; The Burial of the Virgin and the Reception of Her Soul in heaven; The Meeting of Sts Dominic and Francis of Assisi. The fifth panel of the predella is lost. The altarpiece would have shown the Virgin and Child and the same saints whose scenes are depicted in the predella.The predella panels show the influence of Masaccio's frescoes in the Brancacci Chapel, specific derivations from them can be detected in most scenes.

./images/923.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Saint Anthony the Abbot Tempted by a Lump of Gold	Tempera on panel	The painting is attributed by some scholars to the workshop of Fra Angelico. Stylistically it is close to the predella pictures of the Santa Trinita altarpiece.
./images/924.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Lamentation over Christ	Tempera and gold on panel	The Lamentation was made for the Dominican confraternity's oratory, the faÃ§ade of which was painted with scenes from the Passion of Christ. It portrayed the loving compassion of the Virgin, Mary Magdalene, and other saints as they mourned the death of Jesus and prepared him for the grave.The bottom of the painting is damaged.
./images/926.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	The Virgin of Humility	Tempera on panel	In this painting, the image of Mary recalls the ideal of beauty promoted in International Gothic art, although her pose and shape give her a three-dimensionality and solidity closer to the art of Masaccio. The Virgin is placed, following the traditional iconography of the Virgin of Humility, on a cushion rather than a throne.The painting is notable for its brilliant and luminous palette, in which reds, blues and golds are harmoniously combined. Also outstanding is the sweetness and spirituality of the faces of the figures, whose poses and gestures are depicted with great naturalism.
./images/927.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	St Francis Receiving the Stigmata	Tempera on wood	In a landscape composed of sharp-edged rocks evoking the rough countryside surrounding the hermitage at Verna, Saint Francis kneels in ecstasy before Christ in the form of an angel. From the wounds of Christ on this cross spring rays that imprint the stigmata on Francis' hands, his feet, and his side. On the right, Brother Leone, seated with his shoulders against the chapel walls, is awakened by the blinding light of the apparition.It is assumed that this panel of unknown origin was part of a predella.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 33 minutes):Michael Haydn: St Francis Mass
./images/928.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	The Adoration of the Magi	Panel	Documents indicate the this tondo may have originally belonged to Lorenzo de' Medici, ruler of Florence and patron of Renaissance artists. Following the three kings a splendid procession, symbolizing all the races of mankind, waits to pay homage to the new-born Christ. The peacock is a symbol of Resurrection. Some scholars believe that Fra Angelico laid out the composition and painted the Virgin and Child and at least some of the figures at the upper right; then his associate and fellow monk Fra Filippo Lippi completed the work.
./images/929.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Adoration of the Magi (detail)	Tempera on wood	This detail of thetondo by Angelico and Lippishows the Virgin, the only one of the main figures in the work considered to be by Angelico. Comparison between her head and those of the Magus kneeling before her and Joseph to her left, reveals that they are modelled in completely different fashions.
./images/930.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Crucified Christ with the Virgin, St John the Evangelist and Cardinal Juan de Torquemada	Tempera and gold on panel	This painting was originally the central panel of a triptych. The arms of the cross stretch right across the panel, as if intended to strengthen its frame. The upper limb takes the form of a flourishing tree, a possible reference to the popular Legend of the True Cross which claimed that the wood used for the crucifixion came originally from the tree of Jesse. In the branches of the tree sits a pelican in its piety, plucking its breast so that blood flows to feed its young, a common symbol of Christ giving of himself for the redemption of the world.Cardinal Juan de Torquemada, a noted Dominican, kneels before the cross, his red cardinal's hat on the ground before him next to the rivulets of blood. On either side of the cross stand the Virgin and St John. The cross is in no landscape or other spatial setting. There is only an abstract gold ground behind. At the foot of the cross is a skull representing Golgotha. Its Spartan design and intense, but quietly expressed, feeling make this a powerful image reminiscent of some of Angelico's earlier frescoes in the convent of San Marco.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 22 minutes):Heinrich SchÃ¼tz: Die sieben Worte am Kreuz SWV 478
./images/931.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	The Lamentation over St Francis	Poplar	This panel was part of the predella of an altarpiece, probably painted for an altarpiece at Pontassieve. Other sections completing the predella depicting scenes from the life of St Francis are in Berlin (The Apparition at Arles), in the Vatican (Receiving the Stigmata), and in Altenburg (St Francis before the Sultan).
./images/934.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Crucified Christ	Fresco	The earliest of Fra Angelico's mural paintings is the Crucified Christ in the Chapter House of San Domenico, the room where the friars, sometimes joined by the laity, assembled for meetings. To enhance its poignant realism, the artist foreshortened Christ's lowered head and torso from the perspective of the kneeling worshipper. The slender, idealized body is anatomically detailed and luminously modelled. The inscriptions - in Hebrew, Greek and Latin - on the titulus of the cross identify Christ as 'Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews.'
./images/935.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Madonna and Child	Detached fresco	The fresco (repainted) was detached and transferred to masonite support.
./images/936.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Virgin and Child	Detached sinopia	This sinopia was discovered beneath a fresco (poorly repainted in the 19th century) above the doorway of the new Novitiate of the monastery in Fiesole. During the restoration in 1960 the original surface reappeared and the sinopia was removed for conservation. It reveals the unmistakable style of Fra Angelico.
./images/937.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Virgin and Child with Sts Dominic and Thomas Aquinas	Detached fresco transferred to canvas	This fresco comes from the monastery of San Domenico da Fiesole, where Fra Angelico, a Dominican monk, was prior. After the monastery was closed in the 19th century this fresco was removed and sold. Originally the fresco was located at the top of the stairs leading to the dormitory.Without pursuing the dynamic action and spatial depth sought by most of his contemporaries, Fra Angelico achieves a sculpture-like monumentality that links this artist with the refined intellectual Piero della Francesca.
./images/946.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Christ the Judge	Fresco	In the summer of 1447 Fra Angelico, assisted by Benozzo Gozzoli and several other minor artists, had painted a fresco of the Prophets in one of the triangular ceiling vaults and Christ the Judge in another in the Chapel of San Brizio, a large Gothic construction built around 1408 in the Orvieto Cathedral. The remaining sections of the ceiling werepainted by Luca Signorelliin 1499-1502.In the centre of the quadrant above the altar, Christ proffers the globe of the universe as he raises his right hand to summon the dead from their graves. Seated upon banks of clouds against a golden background, he radiates a gilded aureole of light, the scintillating rays of which illuminate the faces and garments of the seraphim surrounding him.

./images/948.jpg	ANGELICO, Fra	Prophets	Fresco	In the summer of 1447 Fra Angelico, assisted by Benozzo Gozzoli and several other minor artists, had painted a fresco of the Prophets in one of the triangular ceiling vaults and Christ the Judge in another in the Chapel of San Brizio, a large Gothic construction built around 1408 in the Orvieto Cathedral. The remaining sections of the ceiling werepainted by Luca Signorelliin 1499-1502.In the quadrant adjacent to that show wing Christ the Judge, Angelico portrayed Old Testament prophets whose writings, it was believed, foretold the coming of Christ. Like Christ, they are painted against a golden ground and suspended on clouds, their garments radiant with the reflected light of his glory. Angelico varied their ages, appearance and attributes, conveying the personality of each man, from the introspective King David, fingering his harp as he composes his psalms, to Moses, his face and azure mantle glowing with the light of God. The tablets held by Moses are inscribed with the first of the Ten Commandments in Hebrew.

./images/957.jpg	ANGELUCCIO	Rural Scene	Oil on canvas	"A 1692 Chigi inventory lists two paintings, the Rural Scene and the Figures in a Tree-lined Avenue (see at Cerquozzi) and indicates that they are the product of a collaboration between Angeluccio, who painted the landscape, and Michelangelo Cerquozzi, who painted the figures.These pictures and the documentary reference to them are an important basis for the reconstruction of the career of Giovanni Angelo, known by his nickname ""Angeluccio"".The biographer Pascoli mentions Angeluccio as a student of Claude GellÃ©e (also known as Claude Lorrain), saying that among Claude's disciples there was ""of renown only Angeluccio, who died young and was only able to work a little"". Perhaps of Flemish origin (he is cited as a Fleming in an eighteenth century inventory of the Valenti Gonzaga collection), he shows the influence of the Flemish landscape technique, with particular closeness to the work of Bril. His typical compositional characteristics are the rendering of a spatial depth, the showing of the horizon through an aperture in the dense foliage of the large trees, the domination of landscape over the relatively tiny figures, and the intense play of light and shadow.Working in Rome probably between 1640 and 1650, Angeluccio was influenced by Swanevelt and Jan Both, and was an active member of the ""Bamboccianti"".Though Miel and van Bloemen also painted figures for Angeluccio's landscapes, the majority of his collaborations were with Michelangelo Cerquozzi. Angeluccio seems to have furnished background landscapes for his fellow ""Bamboccianti"" much as Viviano Codazzi executed architectural backgrounds for them. A hypothesis has even been advanced that the nickname ""Angeluccio"" is derived from the closeness of this artist to ""Michele Angelo"" Cerquozzi. The fruits of this collaboration entered into numerous important Roman collections in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the inventories of which either report the pictures as ""by Angeluccio with figures by Cerquozzi"", or as landscapes by Angeluccio alone."

./images/969.jpg	ANGUISSOLA, Lucia	Self-Portrait	Oil on panel	This is the only known self-portrait by Lucia Anguissola, younger sister of Sofonisba. She portrays herself sitting down in an elegant but modest attire. She wears dark clothing under which appears a white blouse. In her left hand she holds a small book open on her lap, while her right hand rests on her chest, She is a young and virtuous woman lifting her gaze towards the viewer.It seems from this painting that Lucia was not less talented then her sister, Sofonisba.
./images/970.jpg	ANGUISSOLA, Lucia	Portrait of Sofonisba Anguissola	Oil on panel	This painting was formerly attributed to Sofonisba Anguissola. The Anguissola sisters turned to each other for inspiration and for their subjects: both Sofonisba and Lucia used their sisters as models for paintings and drawings.
./images/971.jpg	ANGUISSOLA, Sofonisba	Bernardino Campi Painting Sofonisba Anguissola	Oil on canvas	One of the period's most inventive portraitists came from Cremona. The noblewoman Sofonisba Anguissola created wry and witty portraits of family members and acquaintances, a subject largely imposed upon her by societal restrictions on female access to models and patrons. Sofonisba's painting of her teacher, painting her portrait - a story within a story - demonstrates how she negotiated her male-dominated world. Anguissola's gaze rivets the viewer of the painting, forcing consideration of what appears to be the inscribing of male authority on the body of the female. Campi's gaze complicates matters, however, since as he paints he, too, looks out of the painting toward what the picture indicates must be his subject, Anguissola. Thus the viewer in front of the painting plays a double role: that of the subject of the painting within the painting, namely Anguissola herself, and of an engaged viewer - watched by both Campi and Anguissola - made complicit in Anguissola's destabilizing of contemporary social norms.
./images/972.jpg	ANGUISSOLA, Sofonisba	Portrait of the Artist's Sisters Playing Chess	Oil on canvas	That women could be intellectually accomplished and highly rational, even strategic, are the complementary themes of a family portrait showing Anguissola's three sisters playing chess. In this painting, which Vasari saw hanging in the artist's family home in Cremona in 1566, the chivalric game of chess takes place in an idealized landscape familiar in late medieval courtly images of the game and not in a tavern or other questionable locale seen in other contemporary representations of gaming. On the far left Lucia looks out at the viewer, dominating our gaze as her arm and obvious expertise dominate the chess board. She has removed two of Minerva's pieces from the game and the younger sister opens her mouth and raises her hand as if to speak. Their youngest companion, Europa, smiles gleefully at the match, carefully observed by an old maid servant at the far right.The three Anguissola women are members of a natural nobility capable of entertaining themselves, their status emphasized by the rich surface detail on their brocaded clothes and the fine Turkish carpet set over their table.
./images/975.jpg	ANGUISSOLA, Sofonisba	Portrait of Minerva Anguissola	Oil on canvas	It is assumed by some critics that the painting represents the artist herself, not her sister Minerva.
./images/976.jpg	ANGUISSOLA, Sofonisba	Portrait of a Nun	Oil on canvas	In the painting the nun wears a lily-white habit which stands out against the dark background. The red and gold bound book of prayers offers the only source of detail. The sitter is usually identified as Elena Anguissola, Sofonisba's younger sister who had been a student of the painter Bernardino Campi along with Sofonisba, and later entered the monastery of San Vincenzo in Mantua assuming the name of Sister Minerva.
./images/977.jpg	ANGUISSOLA, Sofonisba	Profile Portrait of a Young Woman	Oil on canvas	Formerly the painting was attributed to Titian, then to Bronzino. The minuteness in the representation of the reobe is noteworthy.
./images/978.jpg	ANGUISSOLA, Sofonisba	Self-Portrait	Oil on canvas	Both the authorship of the portrait and the identity of the sitter are debated. The painting perhaps was executed by Sofonisba's sister, Lucia, and the sitter could be Minerva, another daughter of Amilcare Anguissola.

./images/980.jpg	ANGUISSOLA, Sofonisba	Self-Portrait at the Easel	Oil on canvas	The artist depicts herself in a simple brownish-red habit, covered by a smooth black waistcoat. Under the dress, she wears a white blouse, closed around the neck, with a high collar and cuffs decorated with folded hems. She is painting a Madonna and Child, shown in a particularly affectionate pose.The depiction of the artist at an easel has a precedentin a self-portraitby the Flemish artist, Catharina van Hemessen, dated 1548, but it is not certain, that Sofonisba was aware  of the existence of this painting.
./images/981.jpg	ANGUISSOLA, Sofonisba	Self-Portrait	Oil on panel	"In this youthful self-portrait, the painter has shown herself dressed simply, with the hem of the ruffled blouse peeping out from under the smooth black waistcoat and brownish cuff.

./images/986.jpg	ANSALDO, Giovanni Andrea	Allegory of the Crowning of Ferdinando II de' Medici	Oil on canvas	The painting is an allegory of the crowning of the young Grand Duke Ferdinando II. His father died in 1621 while the prince was still a child, and he became Grand Duke on coming of age in 1629. His mother Maria Maddalena of Austria and his grandmother, Cristina of Lorraine acted as regents during this lengthy period.
./images/987.jpg	ANSALDO, Giovanni Andrea	The Flight into Egypt	Oil on canvas 170 x 127 cm	"The unusual iconography, with the Madonna dressed in the habit of a gypsy, makes it interesting to trace the different interpretations of the painting. The concept of Ansaldo's work may derive directly from a work by Luca Cambiaso that Ratti saw during the eighteenth century at the Palazzo Barberini. In his notes on Soprani's biographies of the Genovese Painters, Ratti described how ""in Rome at the Palazzo Barberini, there is a painting of the Virgin dressed in the manner of the gypsies, who flees to Egypt with the infant Christ in her arms"".To support this hypothesis it is necessary to refer to two known Cambiaso paintings of the head of the Madonna with an identical attire, datable to around 1570, which may be smaller-format versions of the lost Palazzo Barberini picture. Even more closely related is a drawing of the Madonna of the Promenade showing the Virgin taking a stroll, wearing the same attire and large hat, and with the child held in a sling over her shoulder. Also similar iconographically and in other ways is a canvas of Bernardo Strozzi (Genoa; private collection). In the context of this connection, it is helpful to recall that Strozzi was in close contact with Ansaldo during the very years to which the painting has been dated.The painting is dated to 1620-30, since its appearance can be connected to other works from Ansaldo's period of full maturity. The numerous stylistic sources that lie at the base of Ansaldo's mature style may be discerned in this work. Cross-breeding with each other and the aforementioned Cambiasesque currents, one recognizes the influence of Barocci (as seen through his Sienese followers Banni and Salimbeni), the well assimilated influence of Rubens, as well as that of Gentileschi, who was working in Genoa during the time that Ansaldo painted this picture."

./images/1001.jpg	ANTHONISZ, Cornelis	Banquet of Members of Amsterdam's Crossbow Civic Guard	Oil on panel	The painting, known as the Banquet of Copper Coin, is the earliest example of a group portrait of guardsmen seated round a banquet table. It shows a rather primitive juxtaposition of single portraits. The stiff somewhat geometrical composition is characteristic of the early group pictures, and so is the bird's-eye view of the table. The arrangement is simple. Fifteen of the seventeen guardsmen have been lined up in two rows, with only a weak attempt to bind them together. Some of the men are looking towards the spectator, some of them elsewhere. This variety of movement slightly relieves the monotony of the setting, but it endangers the unity. The relief-like arrangement in planes parallel to the surface is characteristic of the Renaissance style. So is the accentuation of the straight horizontal and vertical directions, both giving a certain architectural firmness to the composition.After the middle of the sixteenth century painters of group portraits adopt a freer arrangement within a more natural space construction.
./images/1002.jpg	ANTHONISZ, Cornelis	Henry VIII of England on Horseback	Hand-coloured woodcut	Anthonisz painted this portrait of Henry VIII on horseback after the king had had his hair and beard cut short in 1535. The coat of arms and inscriptions make it quite clear whose portrait this is. 'Dieu et mon droit' is the motto of the British royal family. This woodcut was made in Amsterdam, but published in Antwerp by Hans Liefrinck. The colouring was added with great care. This was probably Liefrinck's first issue of the series of royal portraits by Anthonisz.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 5 minutes):Camille Saint-Saens: HÃ©nri VIII, Scene and Henry's aria

Perhaps for this reason, he was an outsider to the established art world and received only a few church commissions. He was thus compelled to earn a living from devotional paintings, especially of the Virgin of the Immaculate Conception. Despite his boasts and pretensions, AntolÃ­nez probably lived like the humble painter seen in his extraordinary work, the Picture merchant, which can be interpreted as a self-mocking representation of his marginal existence.

Her attributes are the roses referring to the legend according to which she wore a crown of thorns from which roses blossomed.
./images/1034.jpg	ANTONELLO da Messina	San Cassiano Altar	Oil on panel	Left side: Saint Nicholas and Saint Maddalena, 56 x 35 cmCenter: Madonna, 115 x 65 cmRight side: Saint Ursula and Saint Dominique, 56,8 x 35,6 cmLittle is known about the artist, except for what has been handed down by Vasari, and later by Ridolfi. The works are attributed to Messina above all because of the strength of the new style of painting, claimed to have been inspired by a journey to Flanders. Still, the artist had his first grounding in the South of Italy. It was certainly here that he brushed shoulders with the Flemish painters and grafted onto his painting a new visual dimension, using colours to broaden space into more airy vistas.In 1475 he was staying in Venice and the San Cassiano altar-piece came as a sequel to a series of works, including the Antwerp crucifixion, and a number of portraits. Designed round a novel architectonic skeleton, this canvas came to be the inevitable model and paragon for all the prestigious painters of the age, from Bellini, with his San Giobbe altarpiece, to Giorgione, the painter of the Castelfranco altar, and Alvise Vivarini, whose altarpiece was destroyed in the Kaiser Friedrich Museum at Berlin in 1945.This particular work of Antonello's, which had so significant an influence on his artistic career, and also on the history of subsequent Venetian painting, disappeared from the Church of San Cassiano in the first decades of the 17th century. Ridolfi mentions it in 1648. Reduced to fragments, it reappeared in the collection of the Archduke Leopold William in Brussels, and was attributed to Giovanni Bellini. About this time, Teniers made copies and engravings of them. In 1700 three or so of the large fragments found their way to Vienna. The two side-wings remained unrecognised until 1928, when they were put on show by Wilde. The Madonna was displayed, attributed now to Bellini, now to Boccaccino (Wickhoff, 1893 and Berenson, 1916-17); the latter was the first to identify in this picture the centre-piece of the San Cassiano altar. Finally Wilde managed to trace the two lateral fragments and tried to reconstruct the whole (1929).This ambitious altarpiece was probably Antonello's most influential work. It has come down to us as a fragment, although by means of old copies, the sensible reconstruction indicates that even before Giovanni Bellini, Antonello produced a characteristically Venetian altarpiece.

./images/1038.jpg	ANTONELLO da Messina	Crucifixion	Oil on panel 52.5 x 42.5 cm	The painting represents Christ Crucified between two Evildoers, with Maria and John the Evangelist.In the work of the Sicilian painter Antonello da Messina the characteristics of 15th-century Flemish and Italian painting are combined in a very balanced way. Antonello, who lived in Naples from 1445, probably became acquainted with Flemish painting through works that were shipped from Bruges to Naples.In addition to this Venetian painting influenced Antonello when he stayed in the Lagoon City in 1475. Elements of this synthesis are already present in the Antwerp Crucifixion.A total of only 12 signed works by Antonello have been preserved. Ten of them are also dated. One of these is the Antwerp Crucifixion. The following text is written in tiny characters on a small piece of parchment on a piece of wood broken off from the crucifix in the left foreground: '1475 Antonellus Messaneus me pinxit.'Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 3 minutes):Guillaume Dufay: Hymn for Easter
./images/1039.jpg	ANTONELLO da Messina	Crucifixion	Tempera and oil on panel	In the nineteenth century, this painting was believed to be by a fourteenth-century German painter. However, since 1902 the attribution to Antonello da Messina is universally accepted, and the panel is considered to be an early masterpiece of the artist. It is the earliest work in a stylistically related series on the subject of the Crucifixion, continued by the versions in London and Antwerp. In the version at Sibiu, Antonello portrays the landscape behind the Crucifixion - the city and the Strait of Messina - from a bird's eye view, from an almost topographical perspective.

./images/1041.jpg	ANTONELLO da Messina	Madonna and Child	Oil on panel	Among the pictures Antonello produced before his stay in Venice is the San Gregorio Polyptych. Its relationship to Netherlandish painting suggests that he was aware of certain examples in Naples where he worked, or that perhaps he may have visited the Lowlands.The Madonna and Child is the central panel of the much damaged San Gregorio Polyptych.
./images/1042.jpg	ANTONELLO da Messina	Portrait of a Young Man	Oil on walnut panel	This small painting is the only portrait by Antonello in which he placed the sitter in  front of an expansive, atmospheric landscape instead of a plain dark background. It is his last and smallest portrait. The identity of the sitter, between twenty and thirty years old, has not been determined.
./images/1043.jpg	ANTONELLO da Messina	Portrait of a Young Man (detail)	Oil on walnut panel	This portrait combine an Eyckian sharpness of focus and particularity with a Latin sense of classical stability and restraint.
./images/1044.jpg	ANTONELLO da Messina	Portrait of a Man	Oil on wood	The painting is one of the portraits which were famed for their realism. Due to his knowledge of Flemish pictures, the painter had made a decisive contribution to the spreading and perfection in Italy of what was at that time the new medium of oil painting, and normally depicted figures in three quarter life-size as statue-like half-length portraits in front of a barrier. As in this portrait, the face is particularly emphasized by the dark background and simple headgear, with the eyes directed straight at the observer.
./images/1045.jpg	ANTONELLO da Messina	PietÃÂ 	Oil on panel	The only work by Antonello still in Venice, where he resided in 1475 and 1476, it was probably painted at the beginning of his stay in the city. The splendid background scene, one of the best preserved parts of this very badly damaged painting, with the apse of the church of San Francesco d'Assisi in Messina, is the artist's tribute to the city of his birth.
./images/1046.jpg	ANTONELLO da Messina	Portrait of a Man	Oil on wood	Tradition has it that when Antonello da Messina returned from Flanders he introduced the technique of oil painting to Venice. He was also influenced by northern painting in his Sicilian search for the individual character of people and things, as is evident from the extraordinary Portrait of a Man, circa 1475. His objective and incisive analysis of forms combines Piero della Francesca's stereometric achievements, Mantegna's use of perspective in his busts and Venetian colour. Its present state of preservation shows that the highlighting on the red robe, has now become blackened by the lead base of the white pigment.By the 1470s Netherlandish pictures were being imported to Venice in great numbers, together with some of the Netherlandish-inspired portraits by Antonello da Messina. While Antonello's portraits show less of the figure and the surrounding space than earlier Venetian examples, their sharp lighting from the left, strongly individualised expressions, and outward-turned eyes give them a powerful physical and personal presence.
./images/1047.jpg	ANTONELLO da Messina	Portrait of a Man	Oil on panel	The genre of portraiture was one of the most important and most enduring new developments of the Quattrocento. This portrait is notable for its use of oils; Antonello da Messina was one of the few 15th-century Italian artists who fully mastered this technique (in contrast to Flemish artists, who used oils on a regular basis). Since oil paint dries much more slowly than tempera, it allows the artist more time to execute the work, and also enables the colours to be applied with much greater fluidity and flexibility.
./images/1048.jpg	ANTONELLO da Messina	Portrait of a Young Man	Oil on wood	All of Antonello's portraits depict men, who are shown bust-length and in three-quarter view. With one exception, the sitters are set against a dark, neutral background. In the group of his early portraits, painted before 1474, he experimented with pose, costume, and expression. The early panels were made in Sicily from the late 1460s onward with an analytical approach that reflects Antonello's admiration for works by Netherlandish artists.In the present portrait, the headgear of the unidentified young man indicates that he was part of the established Venetian community in Messina.
./images/1050.jpg	ANTONELLO da Messina	Salvator Mundi	Oil on panel	This superb panel painting has been mistreated over the centuries, and to complicate matters, the artist himself had adjusted his original ideas, including a change in the placement of Christ's right hand. The insistent frontality of the figure recalls Byzantine images. Antonello's use of oil as a medium, a technique shared with Flemish painters, allowed him to produce more impressive trompe l'oeil effects like the cartellino applied to the bottom of the picture.
./images/1051.jpg	ANTONELLO da Messina	St Sebastian	Oil on canvas transferred from panel	This is a late work of Antonello showing Venetian influences. In the background typical Venetian buildings are depicted.Antonello's Saint Sebastian is an appealing picture which offers a wide range of visual stimuli. Seemingly oblivious to the arrows which pierce his body, the young Saint Sebastian is tethered to a tree, partially nude and in discreet contrapposto. The vanishing point is low on the horizon, so that the recession into space is sudden, if not dramatic, emphasized by the foreshortened column fragment in the right foreground.
./images/1052.jpg	ANTONELLO da Messina	St Jerome in his Study	Oil on wood	The complicated problems of perspective of the architectural setting are solved excellently by the painter. The scene was also depicted in anengraving of DÃ¼rer.
./images/1053.jpg	ANTONELLO da Messina	Trivulzio Portrait	Oil on panel	Antonello's approach to portraiture combined a tight, accurate, particularizing style with an insight into the psychology of his sitter. In this area, too, he had a palpable impact on Giovanni Bellini, and the similarity of their styles has from time to time caused a shifting of attribution for certain portraits.The painting is named for the Milanese collection to which it once belonged.
./images/1056.jpg	ANTONIAZZO ROMANO	Annunciation	Wood	Antoniazzo executed this altarpiece for the Chapel of Annunciation in Santa Maria sopra Minerva, Rome. The painting was commissioned by Cardinal Juan de Torquemada who is seen on the painting as presenting three girls to the Virgin.

The Madonna is flanked by St Paul and St Francis.The picture, which has suffered from numerous restorations, was originally on the high altar of the church of San Paolo in Poggio Nativo. Iconographically, it is an example of the most traditional altarpiece format. In terms of style this piece locates Antoniazzo between the Melozzo da Forli and the Umbrian school, two influences that summarize the basic currents of Antoniazzo's pictorial culture."
./images/1062.jpg	ANTONIAZZO ROMANO	Nativity with Sts Lawrence and Andrew	Tempera on panel	"Formerly listed in the Barberini inventories as a work of Ghirlandaio, this painting has had various attributions attached to it. It was once given to an anonymous master influenced by Melozzo da Forli, who took his name ""The Master of the Barberini Nativity"" from this picture. However, the painting is identifiable with Antoniazzo Romano on account of its closeness to the same artist's Nativity at CivitÃ  Castellana, and datable to the years between 1480 and 1485. This painting stands as a fundamental work for the understanding of Roman painting of the second half of the fifteenth century. The iconography, with the infant Christ lying in a bundle of grain - a reference to Eucharistic symbolism - also includes the anemone and cyclamen in the foreground, both flowers that symbolize the passion of Christ.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 16 minutes):Arcangelo Corelli: Concerto grosso in g minor op. 6 No. 8 (Christmas Concerto)"

It once formed part of a triptych depicting the so-called Madonna di San Luca, with the wings comprising images of Sts Peter and Paul, along with this portrait and the sitter's coat of arms. This triptych was dismembered and separated prior to 1923, and the present panel is all that is extant.The Madonna di San Luca was one of the most venerated images of the Virgin in Rome. It was said to have been painted by Saint Luke himself; actually, it appears to have been painted in the 11th century.

./images/1067.jpg	ANTONIO DA CREVALCORE	Portrait of a Man	Tempera on wood	In the last centuries this painting was attributed to different painters based on the initials to be found in the lower part of the picture. Since these initials were resolved as A. F(errariensis) P(ixit), the painting was mentioned for a long time as the work of A.F. Master from Ferrara. Later it was attributed to Baldassare Estense, the natural son of NiccolÃ² III d'Este. Finally, the attribution to the Bolognese painter Antonio Leonelli da Crevalcore (Crevalcore is north of Bologna) seems to be final.The painting shows a carefully coifed, tight-lipped sitter in sharp profile behind an elaborate window casement of luxurious marbles. Matrimonial objects, a pearl and a gold ring set with a ruby are displayed on a breviary that projects into the viewer's space.The identity of the young man on the picture is not established. Constanzo Sforza, Antonio Ordelaffi or somebody from the Fugger family are usually mentioned as possible identification.This portrait is the artist's earliest surviving work and the one that most reveals his indebtedness to the example of Francesco del Cossa.
./images/1068.jpg	ANTONIO DA FABRIANO	Coronation of the Virgin	Tempera on wood	Originally this panel was the front of a double-sided standard that would have been carried in processions. The reverse of the standard represented the stigmatisation of St Francis. Noteworthy is the rich ornamentation.The standard, the reverse side of which is dated 1452, is a copy of the standard that Gentile da Fabriano painted for the Franciscan church in Fabriano around 1420.
./images/1069.jpg	ANTONIO DA FABRIANO	St Jerome in His Study	Tempera on wood	"This panel was intended for devotional use in a home or a monastic institution. The subject of St Jerome in his study was an autonomous one in the mid-fifteenth century in Flemish art. In accordance with Flemish practice, Antonio da Fabriano painted his name ""antonio de fabr[ian]o"" on a fictive cartellino on the bottom of the frame, which is original.Antonio makes the domestic description of Jerome's study humbler and more real through such details as the veining and knots in the wood, the cardinal's hat hanging from a nail, and the small crucifix affixed to the keystone of a brick archway. There is a still-life of books randomly scattered on shelves together with a candlestick and an hourglass. Antonio's Flemish tendencies could be the result of a journey to Naples or Genoa in the 1440s,"

The crown, made especially for the coronation, consists of over 5000 diamonds (about 3000 carats) topped by an enormous 415-carat red spinel. The orb, made of solid gold, is enhanced by a band of diamonds and by a 47-carat sapphire.

Napoleon commissioned the Lombard painter Andrea Appiani â who like many liberals in Milan had welcomed the French - to create a suitable memorial. In Appiani's subtle conception, the general is still very much alive, reading a service order; only his profile pose (a convention for pictures of the dead) and the distant allegorical figures of Time pursued by Death suggest a posthumous portrait. Rather than Italy, it is his former service in Egypt, where he had earned his nickname of 'Just Sultan', that is acknowledged by the two turbaned Mamluks, and he appears in a peaceful role, with sword sheathed and in civilian clothes.

In front is the oldest daughter, Anna, the later wife of Philip II of Spain, behind are the sons Rudolf, later Emperor Rudolf II and in the cradle Archduke Ernst.This painting is a copy by Arcimboldo after an original executed in 1553-54 by an unknown artist who based his work on full-figure portraits by Jacob Seisenegger and Anthonis Mor.
./images/2252.jpg	ARCIMBOLDO, Giuseppe	Bust of a Daughter of Ferdinand I	Oil on wood	This painting belongs to a series of busts of Ferdinand I's daughters (and of Anna, the daughter of Maximilian II) which includes a total of seven paintings of varying formats and styles. All seven paintings are attributed to Arcimboldo.The concordance of the individually represented archduchesses is only given tentatively. It seems that the painter may have worked from drawings, possibly from a different hand.The present portrait probably represents Archduchess Magdalena, the unwed archduchess vowed to live her life under the spiritual guidance of the Jesuits.

It seems that the painter may have worked from drawings, possibly from a different hand.Through a comparison to other portraits, this painting can be safely identified as depicting Archduchess Johanna, the youngest and last daughter of Ferdinand I and Anna of Hungary. In 1565 Johanna was wed to Francesco de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, bearing him many daughters, among them Maria, who would later marry King Henry IV of France.

./images/2258.jpg	ARCIMBOLDO, Giuseppe	Spring	Oil on oak wood	This painting in Madrid could have been originally part of the Viennese series of Four Seasons. Arcimboldo painted it in 1563 for Archduke Maximilian (later Emperor Maximilian II). The picture arrived in Spain possibly as a gift to King Philip II.Of all the season-heads, Spring offers less surprises than the other three season allegories. The form of the head is simply filled out with flowers, the breast with leaves. At the same time, however, Spring surpasses all of Arcimboldo's composite heads in its richness of species. 80 different varieties of flowering plants can be counted. Only Water with 62 species comes close to Spring.
./images/2259.jpg	ARCIMBOLDO, Giuseppe	Summer	Oil on panel	The painting is part of a cycle dedicated to the four seasons. Each one is symbolically represented by a startling and evocative juxtaposition of fruits and objects typical of that time of the year. Arcimboldo found this subject particularly congenial and often painted groups of pictures on a theme. Not only did he paint the four seasons, but also the four elements (Earth, Air, Water, and Fire).The painting originally belonged to a series of the Four Seasons. Summer, the only dated picture of the series, carries the date 1563. For the first time, Arcimboldo composes heads from all kinds of objects, whose selection gives meaning to the allegory. As attested by among others,a maiolica platefrom 1536, this compositional method was certainly not invented by Arcimboldo, but the sophistication and imagination with which the painter applies the themes in the picture-puzzles are a very personal achievement, and the many later copies serve to reveal in their weaknesses and simplifications Arcimboldo's true originality.In the profile bust of Summer, the cheek and neck area are composed of a large peach, quince, garlic, white young onions, yellow beets and white eggplant; the mouth and lips are formed of cherries and the open peapod within imitates a row of teeth. The nose is a young wild cucumber and the chin is a pear; the eye shines as a glassy sour cherry between two small pears. The bulge of the forehead seems to be made of brown-skinned onions; even the eyebrows - a curved grain-ear - are not overlooked. On the temple are three hazelnuts in their covers, and in the place of the ear is a dried corncob. The ensemble is completed with a head covering, effectively a cap or a hat made of fruit and vegetables bedded in greenery, from which emerge oat spikes resembling a hat feather. The clothing in woven straw has a single artichoke and the woven signature and date sophisticatedly integrated into the composition as jewellery.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 10 minutes):Vivaldi: Concerto in G minor RV 315 op. 8.

./images/2261.jpg	ARCIMBOLDO, Giuseppe	Winter	Oil on panel	The Winter originally belonged to a series of the Four Seasons of which the Summer is also in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna.The profile bust is composed entirely of a gnarly tree-trunk. The nose is the cracked growth of a branch, moss forming the stubble of a beard and intricate branches forming the scrubby hair, in which an evergreen ivy grows. The mouth is composed of two tree fungi. The vacant, squinting eye is ingeniously created through a crack in the bark. From the breast protrudes a sprig carrying two lemons. Again, the clothing is made of woven straw, in which one can make out a large  M (for Maximilian II) and the firesteel referring to the Order of the Golden Fleece.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 11 minutes):Vivaldi: Concerto in F minor RV 297 op. 8 No. 4 (Winter)
./images/2263.jpg	ARCIMBOLDO, Giuseppe	Spring	Oil on canvas	"This painting belongs to a four-part cycle of the Seasons which was frequently repeated by the Milan artist for the Imperial court in Vienna and Prague. This particular series, which is now in Paris, had been commissioned by the Emperor Maximilian II for Augustus the Elector of Saxony.The series of the Seasons in the Louvre differ from the original Viennese model in the nature of the support, with canvas taking place of wood. The majority of the known versions of the Seasons are painted on canvas. This support may have been chosen for the convenience of the transport for which these works were intended by the man who commissioned them.The series in the Louvre is the only one to have a border formed of garlands of leaves and flowers around the heads. This feature is clearly a later addition as the greenery is depicted in a perfunctory fashion with a broader brush and in places clumsily superimposed on Arcimboldo's painting. It is assumed that it was added in the 17th century at the time of the restoration and enlargement of the original canvas.The Italian art historian Giovanni Paolo Lomazzo (L'Idea del Tempio della pittura, Milan, 1590) described Arcimboldo's allegories as ""teste composte"" (composed heads). The underlying principle of these compositions is the use of elements from an object area which is clearly distinct from others and in such a way that they add up to a personified figure. The individual elements as such do not have any mimetic properties; they only receive them when they co-occur with others.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 9 minutes):Joseph Haydn: The Seasons, Part 1 Spring, Introduction, aria and chorus"

./images/2267.jpg	ARCIMBOLDO, Giuseppe	Summer	Oil on canvas	This painting, formerly thought to be a workshop replica, is now considered an authentic variation of the Summer in Vienna. Because of the similar dimensions and support, the Autumn on loan at the Denver Art Museum and the Winter in the Menil Collection, Houston probably belonged to the same series.
./images/2268.jpg	ARCIMBOLDO, Giuseppe	Autumn	Oil on canvas	Because of the similar dimensions and support (canvas), the Summer and the Autumn in Denver, and the Winter in Houston are considered to belong to the same series of Four Seasons.Since the version of Autumn from Arcimboldo's initial series of Seasons, dated 1563, is lost, this version of Autumn is important as representing the earliest surviving depiction of that season by Arcimboldo. Comparison of this painting of Autumn with an authentic version dated 1573 (in the Louvre, Paris) indicates a similar manner of construction, same materials, and similar touch. On the other hand, notable discrepancies do exist between significant details in the two paintings: they have different tonalities and even hues, as well as treating the individual forms differently.
./images/2269.jpg	ARCIMBOLDO, Giuseppe	Winter	Oil on canvas	Because of the similar dimensions and support (canvas), the Summer and the Autumn in Denver, and the Winter in Houston are considered to belong to the same series of Four Seasons.The larger dimensions of this depiction of Winter and the consequent extension of details in the branches in the head do suggest that this painting is a variant, rather than a replica, of Arcimboldo's earlier version of the theme in Vienna. Other differences in details and qualities of execution support the hypothesis that it may be by the artist himself.
./images/2270.jpg	ARCIMBOLDO, Giuseppe	Spring	Oil on wood	The series of the Four Seasons, which belongs to the collection of the Bayerischen StaatsgemÃ¤ldesammlungen, Munich, is completely anomalous both in its many details and its format, and it is distinct from the autograph versions in Vienna and Paris. The series is a workshop version of Arcimboldo's original allegories. Three of them can currently be seen at the Kunstkammer in the Trausnitz Castle, Landshut, the fourth, the Autumn, because of its poor condition, is deposited at the Alte Pinakothek in Munich.
./images/2271.jpg	ARCIMBOLDO, Giuseppe	Summer	Oil on wood	This painting, presently exhibited in Trausnitz Castle, Landshut (on loan from the Bayerischen StaatsgemÃ¤ldesammlungen, Munich) is a workshop version of Arcimboldo's original allegory.

./images/2273.jpg	ARCIMBOLDO, Giuseppe	The Four Seasons in one Head	Oil on poplar wood	"This work was painted for Don Gregorio Comanini, a Mantuan man of letters. He gives the following description of the painting in his dialogueIl Figino,published in 1591:""Please have Comanino show you that piece of art that he made of the four seasons. The you will see a very special painting!A very knotty trunk represents the breast and head, some holes for the mouth and eyes, and a protruding branch for the nose; the beard is made of strands of moss and some twigs on the forehead form horns. This tree-stump, without its own leaves or fruit, represents winter, which produces nothing itself, but depends  on the production of the other seasons.A small flower on his breast and over his shoulders symbolizes spring, as well as a bundle of ears bound to some twigs, and a cloak of plaited straw covering his shoulders, and two cherries hanging from a branch forming his ear, and two damsons on the back of his head represent summer.And two grapes hanging from a twig, one white and one red, and some apples, hidden among evergreen ivy sprouting forth from his head, symbolize autumn.Among the branches in the head, one in the middle is loosing a bit of its bark, and pieces of it are bent and falling off; on the white area of this branch is written 'ARCIMBOLDUS P.'.This is how the painting is, in any case, and if you see it, it will please you wonderfully."""
./images/2274.jpg	ARCIMBOLDO, Giuseppe	The Four Seasons in one Head (detail)	Oil on poplar wood	"From the branch protruding from the upper-right side of the head hangs the bark, scrapes off in two tatters. In the veins of the wood lain bare appears Arcimboldo's carved signature, ""ARCIMBOLDUS P.""."
./images/2275.jpg	ARCIMBOLDO, Giuseppe	Air	Oil on canvas	This painting is identifiable with a picture of Air by Arcimboldo. It is a copy after Arcimboldo's painting, or perhaps a workshop version from a later series of elements, or perhaps a repetition made for the emperor.Like Earth and probably Water in the series, Air is also based on studies from nature. Many of the birds whose heads are seen in this composite were drawn by Arcimboldo, along with many other avian species. However, because they are crowded together, the individual species represented here are harder to identify.
./images/2276.jpg	ARCIMBOLDO, Giuseppe	Earth	Oil on panel	The composition of the head out of various creatures, its profile view, approximate dimensions, and support all correspond to the series of Seasons and Elements. Earth is the most complex of either series. Like the other paintings in both series, it can be identified as an imperial allegory: this suggests that the emperor rules over the elements and the seasons.Many studies of animals by Arcimboldo exist, and many of these studies were used as sources for the creatures seen in Earth. All the animals in the head were taken from life, because the emperor gave Arcimboldo permission to draw creatures in his menageries.This version of the Earth was made for Maximilian II, or possibly Rudolf II. However, while there is no doubt about its authenticity, discrepancies with Water and Fire of 1566 do exist as far its dimensions, and more fluid handling are concerned, so it is possible that it might not have belonged to the original series of Elements.
./images/2278.jpg	ARCIMBOLDO, Giuseppe	Fire	Oil on wood	The painting is one of the series representing the Four Elements. From the series, Fire and Water are in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, Earth is now in a Viennese private collection. Air has been lost and only exists in copies.The allegory of Fire combines objects that are more or less directly related to fire in a bizarre profile head. The cheek is formed by a large firestone, the neck and chin are formed by a burning candle and an oil lamp, the nose and ear are contoured by firesteels; a blond moustache is formed by a crossed bundle of wood shavings for kindling, the eye is an extinguished candle stub, the forehead area is a wound-up fuse, the hair of the head forms a crown of blazing logs. The breast is composed of fire weapons: mortar and canon barrels together with the respective gunpowder shovel and a pistol barrel.Prominently positioned in the picture is the collar of the Order of the Golden Fleece, beneath which the imperial double-eagle can be seen: a clear reference to the Habsburg House and the beneficiary of the series, Emperor Maximilian II.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 18 minutes):Handel: Fireworks Music

From the series, Fire and Water are in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, Earth is now in a Viennese private collection. Air has been lost and only exists in copies.Water is composed of a multitude of aquatic animals. (The listing of the aquatic animals contains 62 species.) The unusual multitude of species here is astonishing, as well as the inclusion of invertebrates, not only of the snail and the crab, but also of worms. On the other hand, common edible fish are missing.In this composition Arcimboldo gave no consideration to the relationship of sizes among the individual animals, as can be seen by comparing the large seahorse with the comparatively small seal.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 28 minutes):Handel: Water Music, Suite No. 1
./images/2281.jpg	ARCIMBOLDO, Giuseppe	Fire	Oil on canvas	This painting is a copy after the original by Arcimboldo. Compared to the original in Vienna, the format is somewhat larger. The picture is darker and the execution is simplified.
./images/2282.jpg	ARCIMBOLDO, Giuseppe	Water	Oil on canvas	This version of Water of exquisite quality remains quite faithful in most details to the original in Vienna; the most noticeable difference is that the pearl necklace is missing, and the squid is missing from the chin area. It was created in the workshop of Arcimboldo.
./images/2283.jpg	ARCIMBOLDO, Giuseppe	Pairs of Allegories	Oil on wood or canvas	In correspondence to the Four Seasons was the series created three years later in 1566, the Four Elements. Through a paired arrangement of the qualities in the objects, warm-cold and damp-dry, the elements correspond to the seasons. Thus, the warm-dry summer corresponds to fire, the cold-damp winter to water, the warm-moist spring to air and the cold-dry autumn to earth. Thereby, through the arrangement of the heads, turned to the left or to the right, corresponding pairs face each other and form a unit. So, if desired, they could be arranged into a pair-grouping in which each head in one series would face its corresponding head in the other, as follows: Spring - Air, Summer - Fire, Autumn - Earth, Winter - Water.This picture shows the pairs Air (Private collection)- Spring (Madrid) as well as Summer (Vienna) - Fire (Vienna).

./images/2285.jpg	ARCIMBOLDO, Giuseppe	Vertumnus	Oil on panel	There is no mistaking this masterpiece of fantasy and virtuoso imagination by Arcimboldo. The mythical Vertumnus (or Vortumnus), god of harvests and abundance, is in fact a bizarre portrait of the Habsburg Emperor Rudolf II. In the sixteenth century the emperor's cosmopolitan court in Prague became a centre of international art, where Arcimboldo moved in the refined and exclusive circles of late European Mannerism. His painting might appear almost irreverent, but in fact is the manifestation of his eager search for new ideas and his exploration of different ways of expression. (It also gives quite a good impression of the Emperor.) This led him to break the usual rules in order to provoke uncensored reactions and emotions. The paintings and objects contained in Rudolf of Habsburg's Wunderkammer (room of wonders) were unfortunately scattered after a Swedish army sacked Prague during the Thirty Years' War (1618-48).
./images/2287.jpg	ARCIMBOLDO, Giuseppe	Flora	Oil on panel	This painting of the Flower Goddess seems to be the painter's own replica of the original signed painting (also in a private collection).
./images/2288.jpg	ARCIMBOLDO, Giuseppe	The Waiter	Oil on canvas	The Waiter is an anthropomorphic assembly of objects related to winemaking such as a cash tap, a ceramic ewer, a leather bound glass, a chianti flask, an awl, a tasting cup, a gradual dipstick, a pewter and a wooden wine-funnel and a hotte.This composition was commissioned by the Emperor Maximilian II for Augustus, Elector of Saxony.
./images/2289.jpg	ARCIMBOLDO, Giuseppe	The Librarian	Oil on canvas	Arcimboldo's most famous works are the fantasy paintings representing human faces and composed from flowers, fruits, fishes and other objects. Sometimes these paintings have allegoric or moral references.Arcimboldo made a number of portraits of people in the immediate entourage of Emperor Maximilian II. These portraits were often composed with the specific tools of their trade or profession. This portrait depicts an old man composed largely of books piled one above and against each other. An open book on top of his head forms his hat. The figure is held together by a cloak shaped from the drapery in the background.The librarian has been interpreted as a portrait of Wolfgang Lazius, a learned collector and scientist who was in charge of the Emperor's Kunstkammer and who arranged his numismatic collection and his library.
./images/2290.jpg	ARCIMBOLDO, Giuseppe	The Jurist	Oil on canvas	This painting is a half-length male portrait. The face is made up of fishes and plucked fowls, the head is covered by a black hat and the fur-lined cloak is open at the front to reveal that the torso consists of books and manuscripts. The manuscripts project above the neckband to form a collar. The figure is terminated below by two volumes.According to contemporary sources, the painting is a portrait of the vice-chancellor of Emperor Maximilian, who was disfigured by an accident and, in addition, had a congenital swelling on one cheek. The portrait testifies to the fascination of the period with abnormality and deformity.
./images/2292.jpg	ARCIMBOLDO, Giuseppe	The Cook	Oil on wood	This painting offers either a grotesque male portrait or, upside down, a hand lifting the lid of a cauldron with a sucking pig and other meat. The composition is arranged so that the man's eye also serves as the eye of a chicken.It is possible that the figure of The Cook masks a real individual at the imperial court. It could be a humorous portrait of the highest court official who superintended the royal household, or it could be instead the portrait of a soldier.

./images/2294.jpg	ARCIMBOLDO, Giuseppe	The Vegetable Gardener	Oil on wood	"This painting belongs to a group called ""reversible heads"" which allow for a dual interpretation when turned upside-down, delighting the viewer with their metamorphosis. Viewed in one direction, the picture shows a traditional still-life: a metal bowl full mostly of vegetables. Turned upside-down, the forms alchemically come to life to produce a grinning face. The chubby cheeks and the long swollen nose obviously allude to the testicles and an erect penis. Similarly, the mushroom lips are reminiscent of the vaginal lips. By deliberately juxtaposing the male and female sex organs the artist clearly wished to refer to the sexual act. A possible interpretation is that the figure represented is Priapus, a fertility deity and protector of gardens."

./images/2296.jpg	ARCIMBOLDO, Giuseppe	Reversible Head with Basket of Fruit	Oil on wood	This composite head, turned upside down, becomes a basket of fruit. When seen as a still-life this depiction of a fruit basket is an important early representative of this genre. It antedates the famousBasket of Fruitby Caravaggio, who might very well have known it. It also anticipates paintings of fruit still-life byFede GaliziaandAmbrogio Figino.The painting emerged on the market at an auction in Sweden in 1999. It comes probably from the collections of Rudolf II in Prague, because many works of art were stolen thence by Swedish troops during the sack of the HradÃ¨any in 1648.

./images/2387.jpg	ARELLANO, Juan de	Still-Life with a Basket of Flowers	Oil on canvas	This still-life was painted in the middle of the 17th century, in the golden age of the Baroque still-life painting. In the 1630s and 1640s many paintings (hunting scenes, animal paintings, bodegones) were commissioned for the palaces in the Buen Retiro Park and Torre de la Parada. These paintings exerted a great influence on Spanish painting in the following years. This influence can be seen in this painting, too.
./images/2388.jpg	ARELLANO, Juan de	Vase of Flowers	Oil on canvas	While paintings of flowers in a vase represented the most conventional type of flower piece in the 17th century, in the pair of Vase of Flowers, now in the same private collection, Arellano has depicted particularly rich arrangements in remarkably ornate bulbous glass vases with gilt mounts. The paintings could be surrogates for actual flower arrangements in the homes of wealthy contemporaries.The apparently natural floral arrangements seen in these paintings were the result of Arellano's careful ordering of the flowers. He derived this type of composition from his study of earlier Flemish flower paintings and prints, and varied it little throughout his career. It is hard to distinguish the flowers he painted from nature from those deriving from other pictures, graphic sources, memory and practice.While the repetitive nature of Arellano's still-lifes would not have been noticed in his own time, when his works were dispersed among different collections, this factor is augmented in pictures united by photography and exhibitions.

./images/2390.jpg	ARELLANO, Juan de	Basket of Flowers on a Plinth	Oil on canvas	The pair of Basket of Flowers on a Plinth, signed and dated 1664, now in the same private collection, was executed when Arellano was at the height of his powers and exemplifies the decorative and stylistic characteristics of his art that made his works so sought after by collectors in the 17th century.Arellano was able to maintain the interest of his admirers by varying the formats of his pictures. In the case of these works, he transformed one of his most popular picture types, the basket of freshly picked flowers, by perching the basket on the edge of semi-ruined classical style entablatures that act as plinths. In creating this architectural fantasy, Arellano borrowed the motifs from the prints of the classical architectural orders of Marcantonio Raimondi (1475-1539), representing in one painting a simplified version of a Corinthian entablature and in the other, an even more simplified version of this, without its frieze. These architectural features enter the pictures from opposite sides, thus allowing the works to flank a central element in a decorative scheme, and endow them with certain grandeur.The combination of ruins and flowers in these paintings heralds a picture type that became particularly popular in the following century.

./images/2392.jpg	ARELLANO, Juan de	Vase of Flowers	Oil on canvas	In this painting, a bulbous glass vase of flowers stands on a bare rock outcrop, a feature that links the bouquet with the outdoors, despite the fact that it is viewed against a nondescript background of a light, neutral colour.Arellano's flower pieces are carefully orchestrated in terms of colour. His arrangements are usually composed of flowers in the primary colours - red, yellow and blue - with white blooms. The artist also habitually painted with high quality pigments and achieved saturated hues of considerable intensity, which gave his paintings great impact and a high degree of legibility when they shared the wall with other works in the richly decorated interiors of contemporary collectors. Unusually among Spanish flower painters, he frequently employed the expensive mineral pigment lapis lazuli in his blue flowers.Although Arellano absorbed some of the lessons of Italian and indeed Flemish flower painting, this mature work demonstrates that he developed a style that was entirely his own. The existence of a simplified replica of this painting (Madrid, Caja Madrid) demonstrates that the painter repeated successful compositions for the wide market to which his art appealed.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 2 minutes):Franz Schubert: Blumenlied (Flower Song) D 431

The painting was produced at the height of the artist's career and is remarkable for the quality of execution. This florero belongs to a small but coherent group of paintings of flowers in a wicker basket on a stone ledge, all of almost identical dimesions, painted by Arellano during the first few years of the 1670's.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 7 minutes):Piotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky: The Nutcracker, ballet suite, op. 71, Waltz of the Flowers

./images/2395.jpg	ARELLANO, Juan de	Basket of Flowers	Oil on canvas	Throughout his career, Juan de Arellano executed flower pieces of a horizontal format that represent bouquets in open weave wicker baskets. During the last decade of his career, he painted a number of these works on a large scale that constitute the apogee of his flower pieces of this type, of which this is a particularly imposing example.In fact, Arellano's style changed little during the last twenty years of his career. However, the flowers in this painting are the product of many years of experience in this field and are modelled with considerable fluency and freshness of touch.

./images/2471.jpg	ARTHOIS, Jacques d'	An Extensive Wooded Landscape with Travellers on a Path	Oil on canvas	Jacques d'Arthois specialised in depicting the varied views from the edges of the forest, rather than the bosky forest interior. In the centre of the present autumnal scene, a narrow path leads the viewer's eye to a group of travellers resting. The painting may possibly depict the Soignies area of Hainaut (now Belgium) where Jacques d'Arthois had a home, and the village seen in the distance is perhaps Casteau. He and several other artists, including Lodewijk de Vadder and Lucas Achtschellinck, who also lived and worked in the forest, later became known as the Soignies forest painters.

Whilst out hunting, Graf Rudolf von Habsburg comes across a priest taking the viaticum to the dying, and in a show of piety hands over his horse for the priest to use.The figures kneeling beside the path in the foreground are probably portraits of the patron's family members.

./images/2477.jpg	ASAM, Cosmas Damian	Assumption of Mary	Fresco	The rather flat ceiling is decorated by a painted, illusionistic architecture. The architectural details are painted in extreme foreshortening.Above the oval main room of the monastery church, a broad concave moulding marks the transition to a domed ceiling. The vaulting opens up into a diadem borne by angels, reiterating the oval ground-plan. Illuminated by invisible windows, we see the saints of the Benedictine order in all the glory of the heavens.It is quite impossible for the spectator to see that this domed setting is actually flat, and that the whole work is not, as is so often claimed, a domed ceiling fresco. By creating a transition from oval to circle, Asam is able to interweave the clouds amongst the pillars so that they help to conceal the base of the (painted) round temple on the oval ceiling aperture. A more intense metaphor for the heavens as a domed and pillared temple borne on clouds can hardly be imagined.On the main side of the fresco we see St George with his eyes raised towards Mary as she is carried upwards to Christ and God, who is holding a crown above the starry nimbus around her head. It is the triumph of the church that is displayed here against the golden background bathed in light, and its effect is all the more overwhelming because Asam has made the architecture his accomplice in illusion.

./images/2493.jpg	ASPERTINI, Amico	Adoration of the Shepherds	Oil on wood	A painter and sculptor educated in the school of Costa and Francia, Aspertini was attracted by fanciful, bizarre forms, elements certainly drawn from North European engravings which were widespread at the time.In this Adoration of the Shepherds the fantastic construction concealing an apse enriched with various elaborate decorations, the figures twisting and darting vivaciously in the most unusual directions, and the tiny, unreal landscape, are enough to convince us that Aspertini was an extremely unusual artist with a decidedly individual and inimitable style.
./images/2495.jpg	ASPERTINI, Amico	Heroic Head	Tempera on wood	The monochrome painting with the stone-like frame is like a relief. However, it is interesting to note that the bust is not in the painted frame but before it.
./images/2496.jpg	ASPERTINI, Amico	Portrait of Tommaso Raimondi	Oil on panel	Amico Aspertini was a Bolognese artist whose work spans the late 15th and early 16th centuries. In his own time he was famed as a portraitist. This portrait demonstrates the artist's mastery of the technique of painting in oils, which were much more flexible than tempera and allowed for far more precise tonal gradation. The play of light and shadow on the face models it and gives it volume, while light also creates the different textures of the clothes, skin and hair, etc.The sitter of this portrait was Tommaso Raimondi, a jurist and poet from Cremona. The artist is clearly interested in portraying his sitter as an individual, albeit by accentuating only his more flattering features.
./images/2497.jpg	ASPERTINI, Amico	View of the Oratory	Fresco	The picture shows a view of the long south wall with scenes 6-10 of the St Cecilia cycle. Above the entrance on the west wall is the balcony which abuts the Bentivoglio family chapel in the adjacent church of San Giacomo Maggiore.St Cecilia is one of the most famous Roman saints, although she is purely legendary. She is meant to have lived in the second or more probably the third century, but only appears in the tradition in the fifth and sixth centuries. A young girl of noble background, she was betrothed, in spite  of her vow of chastity, to a noble Roman, Valerius. After the apparition of an angel in the marriage chamber, she converted the young man to Christianity and persuaded both him and his brother, Tibertius, to receive baptism. She then refused to make an offering to the pagan gods and was condemned to be suffocated in a boiler, but was saved by the descent of a refreshing cloud from the sky. She was then taken to be beheaded, but the executioner, even after three violent blows, could not detach her head. She lingered on, mutilated, for three days before expiring.The fresco cycle in the Oratory of St Cecilia consists of ten scenes from the legend of Saints Cecilia and Valerian, located on the north (scenes 1-5) and south (scenes 6-10) walls of the Oratory, which is connected by a passageway to the church of San Domenico Maggiore. The cycle, resembling a continuous frieze, is very different from the sort of painting normally found in parish churches. It bears a greater resemblance to the suites of canvases produced for Venetian oratories and assembly rooms.The ten horizontal panels, each filled with life-size figures in the foreground, create the impression of a continuous pictorial narrative, one that is structured but not actually interrupted by the framing pilasters. The continuous background landscapes incorporate scenes from the legend of St Cecilia, a large part of which involves the conversions and martyrdoms of her husband Valerian and his brother Tiburtius. Also depicted are the Roman official Maximus, another convert, and Pope Urban I as the saints' protectors, who are soon afterward martyred themselves.The predominant character of the cycle completely reflects the styles of the two masters who set the tone for the Bolognese school in around 1500, namely Lorenzo Costa the Elder and Francesco Francia. They must be regarded as the ones who devised the St Cecilia cycle, which was ultimately realized by collaborators whose names can no longer be determined with the exception of two panels with the signature of Amico Aspertini. The fact that the first pictures on each wall are by Francia would indicate that he was the supervisor of the project.Three pairs of scenes were executed by Francesco Francia, Lorenzo Costa the Elder, and Amico Aspertini. The author of the two other pairs are not known, here we present the reproductions of these scenes among the works by Francesco Francia.The scenes of the cycle are the following:Scene 1:Marriage of Cecilia and Valerian(Francesco Francia)Scene 2:Valerian with Pope Urban(Lorenzo Costa the Elder)Scene 3:Valerian is Baptized(unknown, displayed in Francesco Francia's section)Scene 4:Coronation of Cecilia and Valerian(unknown, displayed in Francesco Francia's section)Scene 5:Martyrdom of Valerian and Tiburtius(Amico Aspertini)Scene 6:Burial of Valerian and Tiburtius(Amico Aspertini)Scene 7:Cecilia Disputing with Almachius(unknown, displayed in Francesco Francia's section)Scene 8:Martyrdom of St Cecilia(unknown, displayed in Francesco Francia's section)Scene 9:Cecilia Gives away Her Possessions(Lorenzo Costa the Elder)Scene 10:Burial of St Cecilia(Francesco Francia)
./images/2498.jpg	ASPERTINI, Amico	Legend of Sts Cecilia and Valerian, Scene 5	Fresco	Scene 5 of the Cecilia cycle in the Oratory of St Cecilia, painted by Amico Aspertini, depicts the martyrdom of Valerian and his brother Tiburtius. The prefect Turcius Almachius summons them for questioning, in the course of which they confess their new Christian faith. In the foreground the prefect and his retainers have gathered at  the foot of a tall column supporting a statue of Jupiter somewhere outside of Rome. The brothers, dressed in white and crowned with flowers, refuse to offer incense to the god and are accordingly beheaded.
./images/2499.jpg	ASPERTINI, Amico	Legend of Sts Cecilia and Valerian, Scene 6	Fresco	Scene 6 of the Cecilia cycle in the Oratory of St Cecilia, painted by Amico Aspertini, depicts the burial of Valerian and Tiburtius. This panel contains obvious allusions to the entombment of Christ, and reminiscences fromRaphael's paintingof the subject.The painting is in a very poor condition.
./images/2504.jpg	ASSCHE, Henri van	Winter Landscape	Oil on panel	The present winter landscape with resting lancers by a bridge depicts a group of Cossacks, with lances, at rest in a hard winter landscape. Van Assche occasionally collaborated with EugÃ¨ne Verboeckhoven (1799-1881), the figures and horses in the present painting were probably painted by Verboeckhoven.
./images/2505.jpg	ASSELYN, Jan	Italian Landscape with the Ruins of a Roman Bridge and Aqueduct	Oil on canvas	"Asselijn studied for some time in France and Rome. On his return to Amsterdam, he specialized in painting animals and Italianate landscapes, which occupied a firm place in Dutch painting. Motifs of the Roman Campagna, ruins, rocks and castles generally dominate his settings peopled with riders and herdsmen. Yet his works owe less to real landscapes than to painterly tradition. Some typical features of the work by this Italianate Dutch artist are the way he bathes his landscapes in atmospherically ""romantic"" golden hues influenced by Claude Lorrain's handling of light, or adopts picturesque motifs in the manner of Salvator Rosa.Italianate as they may be, these paintings are nevertheless easily identifiable as the work of a Dutch artist, for the genre generally lacks the pathos formula of the Baroque and the antique ruins tend to blend into the rest of the landscape like elements in a srill-life. The genre components can be found in the procession of mules, their riders and the figures on the bridge.Like a piece of broken bread or a cracked earthenware jug, the ruins unfurl their melancholy beauty in the tranquil evening light, recalling the transcience of earthly life in a highly aesthetic way."
./images/2506.jpg	ASSELYN, Jan	Beggars in front of a Roman Limekiln	Oil on wood	This canvas is one of the rare 'Bambocciata' paintings by Asselyn, painted during trips through Rome with Jan Both between 1638 and 1640. (Bambocciata: genre scene of popular life in the suburbs of Rome made popular by the Netherlandish painter Pieter van Laer, known in Italy as Il Bamboccio.) it depicts one of the many limekilns in Rome, where antique fragments were utilised to make Baroque building material. Beggars and homeless people are playing morra and warming themselves on the roof of the kiln.
./images/2507.jpg	ASSELYN, Jan	The Breach of the Sint Anthonisdijk	Oil on canvas	This is a painted record of a dramatic historical event. On the night of 5-6 March 1651, strong north-westerly winds and a high spring tide caused the Sint Anthonisdijk to rupture in two places, flooding much of the city of Amsterdam. For the Italianate painter Jan Asselyn, this most Dutch of subjects is a great rarity.
./images/2508.jpg	ASSELYN, Jan	Cavalry Engagement	Oil on canvas	This signed and dated painting is an early work that already reveals the mastership of the young Asselyn, who is rightly considered one of the most important landscapists active during the first half of the 17th century. The natural environment and the topographical situation are suppressed here in favour of the battle scene. Asselyn assigns to the spectator the role of an eyewitness amidst the Netherlandish Wars of Independence. Later on, the artist became famous for his landscapes of the Campagna, which date from his sojourn in Italy.
./images/2509.jpg	ASSELYN, Jan	Coastal Scene with Resting Riders	Oil on canvas	This coastal scene shows the painter's familiar compositional style. Pictorial depth is created out of the contrast between close-up and distant views, between the anecdotal and comical observation of the resting riders disputing over which route to take next and the soft forms of the remote mountains beyond the bay.
./images/2511.jpg	ASSELYN, Jan	Italianate Landscape with a River and an Arched Bridge	Oil on canvas	Jan Asselyn was Jan Both's exact contemporary, but he had a much wider repertoire than Both. He made his mark with exquisite Italianate landscapes bathed in a luminous light in which large-scale ruins often play a dominant role.
./images/2512.jpg	ASSELYN, Jan	Italianate Landscape with Peasants and Animals Fording a River	Oil on oak panel	Jan Asselyn was in Italy from the end of 1635 until 1644/5, when he travelled back to The Netherlands, which he reached by 1647. The painting reflects the influence of Claude Lorrain.
./images/2513.jpg	ASSELYN, Jan	Landscape with Ruins and Hunting Party	Oil on canvas	The painting is a depiction of hunters in a timeless atmosphere that pass by the viewer and a peasant who greets them and finally vanish through a dilapidated arch. This is a typical image of the South seen by a Dutch painter.
./images/2514.jpg	ASSELYN, Jan	Mountainous Landscape with Traveling Herdsmen	Oil on wood	Asselyn painted his Italian landscapes from memory after returning to the Netherlands. The Mountainous Landscape with Traveling Herdsmen he synthesized his image of Italy without including any details that otherwise introduce an Italian mood into his pictures.
./images/2515.jpg	ASSELYN, Jan	Italian Landscape with SS. Giovanni e Paolo in Rome	Oil on canvas	The artist painted the early Christian basilica after his drawing (now in the Albertina, Vienna), while the landscape is imaginary.
./images/2516.jpg	ASSELYN, Jan	River Bank with Herdsmen	Oil on panel	Asselyn probably stayed in Rome from 1636 to 1644. After returning to Amsterdam he continued to paint Italian landscapes such as the River Bank with Herdsmen painted around 1650.
./images/2517.jpg	ASSELYN, Jan	The Threatened Swan	Oil on canvas	Asselyn's early works, dated 1634 and 1635, are little views of ferocious cavalry skirmishes which suggest he was apprenticed to Jan Marsten the Younger, a Haarlem battle painter who was a pupil and follower of Esaias van de Velde. Soon afterwards he was said to have travelled to Rome and remained there until about 1643-44. No painting can be documented to his Roman sojourn but on the basis of stylistic evidence a sufficient number establish he was there, and had close contact with the Bamboccianti as well as an opportunity to take a hard look at Claude's landscapes. Additionally, he made drawings, often animated with wash, of the grand and modest sights of Rome.Asselyn returned to the Netherlands via France where he married in Lyon in 1644-45. Then he moved to Paris where he worked with Swanevelt. By 1647 he was in Amsterdam where he spent the remaining five years of his life. During the brief period he specialized in Italian views saturated with silvery and golden atmospheric effect; he was one of the first to bring Claude's pure and light way of painting landscapes to Holland. He also painted winter and night scenes and views of his native land, and pictures of animals and birds as well. His Threatened Swan depicts a life-size swan defending its nest against a dog swimming towards it.With menacingly outspread wings, the swan is vigorously defending its nest against the dog swimming up from the left. The scattered feathers and the low angle from which the bird is viewed emphasize its fury.The painting was transformed at a later date into an allegory on the vigilance of the Grand Pensionary Johan de Witt by inscriptions added by an unknown hand: under the swan 'De Raad-Pensionarie' (the Grand Pensionary); on one of the eggs in the nest 'Holland'; and above the dog, 'de viand van de Staat' (the enemy of the State). Thus the swan was meant to represent the Grand Pensionary protecting Holland. The enemy was presumably De Witt's adversary, England.

./images/2519.jpg	ASSERETO, Gioachino	The Finding of Moses	Oil on canvas	The disposition of a group of three-quarter length figures, gathered around a central point, seems to be a compositional motif which recurs in Assereto's large paintings at around 1640. The focal point here is the baby Moses and all the figures' gestures and expressions are directed towards him.
./images/2520.jpg	ASSERETO, Gioachino	Isaac Blessing Jacob	Oil on canvas	This canvas is regarded as one of the finest paintings of this undeservedly forgotten artist, whose works have frequently been ascribed to other masters. In the eighteenth century the present painting was variously attributed to Jusepe de Ribera, Bernardo Strozzi, and Matthias Stomer.
./images/2521.jpg	ASSERETO, Gioachino	Mocking of Job	Oil on canvas	This canvas was a great success which is proven by the numerous derivations on the part of pupils and imitators. Here, as in other works from his final period, Assereto very effectively unites Caravaggesque naturalism, imbued with humanity, and vibrant pictorial rendering, moving towards the tenebrism that was later fully developed in Venice by another Genoese master, Giovan Battista Langetti.

Tobias was sent by his father Tobit to Media to recover a sum of money he had hidden there earlier. Archangel Raphael, sent by God to help Tobit and his family, asked Tobit (who did not recognize the angel) whether he may escort his son on his journey and, in company with Tobias' faithful hound, they departed together. They reached the Tigris, where Tobias was attacked by a gigantic fish. The archangel ordered him to capture it and had him remove and conserve its gall, heart and liver. The innards proved to be a medicine which he can use to restore his father's sight.

./images/2527.jpg	AST, Balthasar van der	Still-Life with Apple Blossoms	Oil on oak	Still-life paintings were popular in Dutch art and began to emerge as a genre in their own right during the 16th century. Despite their popularity with the general public, art academies of the period did not regard them as highly as landscape or religious paintings.
./images/2529.jpg	AST, Balthasar van der	Basket of Fruits	Oil on wood	"Typically, Italian and French fruit still-lifes in the 17th century tend towards a strictly objective description of the actual phenomena. The Dutch, on the other hand, were still in the tradition of ""disguised symbolism"" (Erwin Panofsky) as something that gave depth to empirical precision. Balthasar van der Ast's Fruit Basket, for example, contains enough additional elements to show that he is concerned with more than a realistic rendering.The vanitas theme is emphasized by the presence of bruises, bad spots and wormholes, as well as insects such as butterflies, dragonflies and house flies, as well as a lizard - a rather unusual sight on a table - which is nibbling at one of the apples outside the basket. Grapes of course, often has a christological reference. If we consider further that, in the context of Virgin Mary, apples symbolize redemption and victory over sin, whereas insects and lizards were often associated with the principle of evil, then this harmless everyday motif suddenly turns into a scene (though on a smaller scale) of good versus evil in the history of salvation."
./images/2530.jpg	AST, Balthasar van der	Bouquet of Flowers	Oil on copper	This small, jewel-like copper shows a bouquet of flowers on a ledge, together with a shell and a grasshopper, a panoramic landscape beyond. In it, Balthasar van der Ast pays directhomage to his brother-in-lawand likely teacher, Ambrosius Bosschaert the Elder.
./images/2532.jpg	AST, Balthasar van der	Still-Life of Flowers, Shells, and Insects	Oil on panel	In this horizontal still-life Van der Ast presents a variety of seashells, flowers, and  insects on a stone surface. At the centre is a horn-shaped shell holding an arrangement of flowers. The painter avoided any overlap or clustering of the shells so that each one can be scrutinized individually.
./images/2535.jpg	AST, Balthasar van der	Flower Still-Life	Oil on oak panel	This still-life includes tulips, roses, an iris and lily of the valley in an ornate glass jug on a stone ledge with a lizard and a shell. While many of Van der Ast's flower pieces are lavishly composed with a wide assortment of blooms, here he has pared down his composition to a simpler but more elegant form.
./images/2536.jpg	AST, Balthasar van der	Flowers in a Vase with Shells and Insects	Oil on panel	In the centre of this painting is a bouquet of flowers in a ceramic vase placed on a stone ledge. Richly patterned seashells - a characteristic feature of Van der Ast's still-lifes -  and a grasshopper are arranged to the sides of the vase. Other insects populating the scene are a bee hovering on the right, a spider crawling on the petals of the yellow rose, and a butterfly resting on the iris at the top. The painting reveals the artist's debt to his teacher Ambrosius Bosschaert the Elder.
./images/2538.jpg	AST, Balthasar van der	Still-life with Dish of Fruit	Oil on wood	Bosschaert's type of flower piece remained popular until after the middle of the 17th century. His most interesting follower is his brother-in-law Balthasar van der Ast who manages to avoid the hard, metallic quality of so many others influenced by Bosschaert. Van der Ast's paintings are more varied than Bosschaert's, and they frequently include lively lizards and toads. His particular speciality is the still-life composed exclusively of shells.
./images/2539.jpg	AST, Balthasar van der	Still-Life with Flowers, Fruit, and Shells	Oil on panel	Balthasar van der Ast learnt to paint from his brother-in-law, Ambrosius Bosschaert. He also specialized in flower still-lifes though he differed from his teacher in his preference for more complex compositions. In this still-life of 1618, he placed two bouquets against the splendid backdrop of Renaissance architecture, which was probably painted by Bartholomeus van Bassen. This strikingly asymmetrical painting is exceptionally large for a still-life, its nearly square format is a rare occurrence in 17th-century Dutch painting.
./images/2540.jpg	AST, Balthasar van der	Still-Life	Oil on oak panel	This painting depicts a still-life of variegated tulips in a ceramic vase, with a wasp, a dragonfly, a butterfly and a lizard. It is a characteristic work from the mid-1620s and displays many of the artist's topoi.

Noteworthy are the extremely large shells featured at the base of this composition.This painting is one of few large-scale upright compositions of fruit or flowers painted by the artist in his entire career.

The influence of Balthasar van der Ast's brother-in-law and teacher, Ambrosius Bosschaert the Elder, is plainly visible in the motifs, the overall composition, and in the painterly effects of this still-life.
./images/2544.jpg	AST, Balthasar van der	Still-Life	Oil on panel	This small panel shows roses with a butterfly and a grasshopper, together with forget-me-nots, primroses and a sand lizard on a stone ledge. It is an example Van der Ast's virtuosity on a small scale.
./images/2545.jpg	AST, Balthasar van der	Still-Life with a Basket of Flowers	Oil on canvas	This still-life, unlike van der Ast's early ones, the arrangement of the still-life looks quite natural, as if the artist simply portraying a basket that he had filled with fresh flowers in his studio. However, the painting was almost certainly carefully composed on the canvas, with the aid of individual studies of the various flowers and other motifs.

./images/2550.jpg	AST, Balthasar van der	Vase of Flowers by a Window	Oil on panel	This is one of the elaborate still-life compositions painted by Van der Ast during his Delft years. The setting shows resemblance to early genre interiors by De Hooch and Vermeer, in particular Vermeer'sLetter Readerin Dresden. Van der Ast's still-lifes from this period are characterized by their exceptional refinement of execution, variety of motifs, and scale.
./images/2555.jpg	ASTRUC, Zacharie	The Chinese Gifts	Watercolour on paper	Astruc, the painter and sculptor, poet and art critic had a good dozen works at the exhibition of the SociÃ©tÃ© anonyme des artists in 1874, mainly watercolours, several of them dealing with the fashion in orientalism.
./images/2562.jpg	ATTAVANTE DEGLI ATTAVANTI	Missal	Manuscript (Ms. 9008)	The full-page miniature is a page (folio 205v) of a Missal (Missale Romanum) signed by Attavante who was one of the outstanding miniaturist of the Florentine Renaissance. He came from an aristocratic family and studied with Francesco di Antonio del Chierico, the most significant Florentine miniaturist of the time. In the 1480s he already worked independently, his first dated and signed work is a Missal in Lyon. Later he worked  in the court of the humanist Hungarian King Matthias and he decorated here more than 30 manuscripts among them the Missal presently in Brussels.The miniature depicts the scene of Calvary which is framed by several small pictures, which are at left from the top down: Annunciation, Nativity, Adoration of the Magi, Circumcision, Christ among the Doctors; at right from the bottom up: Christ in the Getshemane Garden, Kiss of Judas, Christ before the Judges, Flagellation, Carrying the Cross. The pictures reflect the influence of contemporary altarpieces.The codex was made for Matthias, King of Hungary. In 1526 it was brought to the Netherlands by the flighting Queen Mary, widow of the Hungarian King Louis II who died in the Battle of MohÃ¡cs against the Turks. Mary became the governess of the Netherlands and the following governors took their oaths on this Missal.
./images/2569.jpg	AUGUSTIN, Jean-Baptiste-Jacques	A Bacchante	Ivory	Augustin was a French miniaturist who revived the art in France. His paintings have strong, pure colours, certainty of execution and high finish.This picture is copied from a painting by Greuze of c. 1794 which probably belonged to Augustin.
./images/2570.jpg	AUGUSTIN, Jean-Baptiste-Jacques	Portrait of the Sculptor Callamard	Miniature on ivory	This portrait was executed when the sculptor Charles Antoine Callamard (1776-1812) was barely twenty-five old, winner of the Prix du Rome in sculpture in 1797. When it was exhibited at the Salon des Artistes Vivants in 1801, the miniature drew the attention of the critics, who praised the unusual delicacy of its execution and the veracity of the sitter's feature.
./images/2572.jpg	AVANZI, Jacopo	View of the Cappella di San Giacomo	Fresco	The frescoes in the Cappella di San Giacomo (Chapel of St James) were commissioned by Bonifacio Lupi di Soragno and his wife, Caterina dei Franceschi. The architecture, designed by the Venetian sculptor and architect Andriolo de' Santi was commissioned in 1372.The painting school of Padua can be ranked as the most vigorous of the northern Italian schools: the painters of Padua built upon Giotto's achievements. The prolific Paduan fresco painters added striking naturalistic observations of their own in landscape, in the painting of animals, and in portraiture. The most successful painters of the period came to Padua from outside - Jacopo Avanzi from Bologna and Altichiero da Zevio from Verona. In the Chapel of St James, to Avanzi have been attributed most of the lunettes of the Life of St James, painted about 1374,  while to Altichiero has been assigned the huge Crucifixion and some of the other lunettes.
./images/2573.jpg	AVANZI, Jacopo	Liberation of the Companions of St James	Fresco	In Avanzi's lunette fresco in the Cappella San Giacomo, the human figures many showing traits of physiognomy and drapery which remind us of Giotto, are dominated by a central mass of rocks. In the foreground a bridge has collapsed, and the persecutors following saint's companions fall into a stream. The floundering horses and humans are represented with striking fidelity.
./images/2574.jpg	AVED, Jacques-AndrÃÂ©-Joseph	Madame Crozat	Oil on canvas	The remarkable portrait of Madame Crozat was shown at the Salon in 1741. In this portrait Aved conveys something of the sitter's character - including a lack of vanity - and her ordinary existence. With her tapestry work and a teapot handy in the background, she might stand as representative of the highest bourgeoisie: sensible, comfortable, industrious. It was thought worth commenting on in 1741 that another woman would have suppressed the fact of those spectacles which Madame Crozat has just taken off and still holds; Aved seizes on this very detail to give a sense of momentary pause in a pleasantly busy domestic life.In the nineteenth century the painting was supposed to be by Chardin.
./images/2580.jpg	AVERCAMP, Barend	Landscape with Frozen River	Oil on oak	As a fishermen mends his nets in the foreground, fancier folk play on the ice in this winter landscape by Barend Avercamp, nephew and pupil of the more famous Hendrick Avercamp.
./images/2581.jpg	AVERCAMP, Barend	Winter Landscape	Oil on beveled panel	Like his uncle, Hendrick Avercamp, Barend specialized in winter scenes, favouring depictions of frozen inlets that were filled with anecdotal details, such as people frolicking on the ice. Here he depicts various figures skating, sledding and playing colf, a game played with clubs and balls made of either wood or sheepskin filled with cow hair. The object of the game was to hit the ball the greatest distance in a set number of strokes, or to hit a target such as pole in the fewest number.
./images/2584.jpg	AVERCAMP, Hendrick	Ice Scene	Oil on panel	The painting depicts a frozen canal with many people amusing themselves. People are skating, sledging and playing a game called 'kolf', a sort of ice hockey. On the left, a group of people have fallen through the ice, but help is already on the way. And just in front of the bridge, a woman has fallen over, revealing her bare bottom.
./images/2585.jpg	AVERCAMP, Hendrick	A Panoramic Winter Landscape	Oil on oak panel	This panoramic winter landscape contains a multitude of figures on a frozen river. It is an early work which, like Avercamp's other early pictures, is packed full of figures on the ice - too many to count - while many of his later works are sparser.The painting was originally painted on a panel comprising two horizontal panels, probably of fairly similar width. After the artist's death, a small section of the top edge of the upper panel was trimmed, presumably to remove the bevel, and a third horizontal panel was glued to it.
./images/2587.jpg	AVERCAMP, Hendrick	A Scene on the Ice near a Town	Oil on wood	Hendrick Avercamp was known as de stom van Kampen (the mute of Kampen) because he was dumb. He was baptized in the Old Church in Amsterdam on 27 January 1585 but in the following year his parents moved to Kampen where his father was the town apothecary. Avercamp seems to have trained in Amsterdam with Pieter Isaacsz., who was a history painter, portraitist and draughtsman in an elegant, late Mannerist style quite unlike that of Avercamp. Avercamp's manner is based in the first place on that of the Flemish followers of Pieter Bruegel the Elder and he presumably came into contact with some of his followers who had settled in Amsterdam, such as David Vinckboons. Avercamp developed the style of Bruegel and Vinckboons in the direction of more decorative effects, creating scenes crammed with small figures and full of incident. He also possessed a refined sense of colour, carefully placing pinks, reds, blacks and whites with touches of yellow and green to create delicate and subtle effects. He principally painted winter scenes and made many watercolours of these and of fishermen and peasants: a large group of these watercolours is in the Royal Collection.There are dated paintings by Avercamp from 1608 until 1632 but they show relatively little development in style: the earlier paintings are more 'Flemish', that is, closer to Bruegel and his followers; but once he had mastered a successful style Avercamp saw little need to change it substantially. The dating of paintings which do not bear a date is therefore difficult but this particular winter landscape appears to be from about 1615. It has been supposed that the building on the right is the Half Moon Brewery at Kampen but only a few barrels outside suggest it is a brewery, and the vaguely indicated town in the distance does not seem to be Kampen. The tower is closer to that of the Sint Cunerakerk in Rhenen.Avercamp was buried in the Sint Nicolaaskerk in Kampen on 15 May 1634. His nephew, Barent Pietersz. Avercamp, who also lived and worked for much of his life in Kampen, was a close follower, as was Arent Arentsz. of Amsterdam.
./images/2589.jpg	AVERCAMP, Hendrick	Winter Landscape with Skaters	Oil on wood	"There are many interesting details in this crowded scene which was certainly inspired by Pieter Bruegel the Elder.Avercamp's early winter landscapes (from before 1608) are very Flemish in technique and composition: a very high horizon, many figures and a composition set up something like theatrical scenery. Between 1610 and 1620, however, the horizon in his paintings drops lower and lower, the scenery-like elements are thinned out and the figures become more grouped within the composition. Around 1615, the theme of ""Winter landscape with skaters"" was gradually transformed into a depiction of the ""Joys of winter"", with the accent clearly on the figures. After 1620, he absorbed the influence of Esaias van den Velde and Jan van Goyen, and his compositions became more enclosed, with the figures melting somewhat into the landscape.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 11 minutes):Vivaldi: Concerto in F minor RV 297 op. 8 No. 4 (Winter)"
./images/2593.jpg	AVERCAMP, Hendrick	Winter Landscape	Oil on panel	The present panel shows a winter landscape with city dwellers and ice skaters.
./images/2594.jpg	AVERCAMP, Hendrick	Winter Scene on a Canal	Oil on wood	Avercamp spent most of his life in the small quiet town of Kampen on the eastern shore of the Zuider Zee. Residence relatively far from the principal artistic centres of the Netherlands helps to explain why this delightful artist, who discovered the pictorial qualities of flat landscapes and was the first to specialize in winter scenes of outdoor sport and leisure, had little influence on the development of Dutch landscape painting.Avercamp's pictures peopled with motley crowds of all ages and classes skating, sledging, golfing, and fishing on the frozen canals of Holland fascinate social historians as well as art historians. The latter sometimes find him a troublesome painter, because it is difficult to trace his development. The plain fact seems to be that he did not have a marked one. From the very beginning he could paint a landscape with a high horizon, a great accumulation of detail, and a number of light colours, or one with a low horizon, few details, and vivid colours in the foreground which lighten as they recede to the distance. The two possibilities existed simultaneously and could be used at will until the end of his career, depending on either the artist's, or his patron's predilections.
./images/2596.jpg	AVERCAMP, Hendrick	Winter Landscape	Oil on oak	Avercamp's early Winter Landscape, with its general view and colourful narrative character, is very much in the tradition of the famous winter landscapes by Pieter Bruegel the Elder. But Avercamp's winter landscapes painted after the 1620s - reflecting the trends of the period - are composed with the now fashionable low horizon and vanishing-point perspective.
./images/2597.jpg	AVERCAMP, Hendrick	Winter Scene	Oil on panel	This panel depicts a winter scene with a windmill and figures on a frozen river. Inspired by the paintings of his great predecessor, Pieter Breugel the Elder and his Flemish followers, Avercamp chose the winter landscape as his primary subject matter and turned it into a uniquely Dutch genre.
./images/2598.jpg	AVERCAMP, Hendrick	Winter Scene (detail)	Oil on panel	Within the landscape are people of all types and classes, which the artist places in singles, groups and pairs that at first seem almost haphazard, but are carefully arranged to pull the viewer's eye  past the ice-bound boats, towards  the city and eventually to the distant horizon.
./images/2600.jpg	AVERCAMP, Hendrick	Frozen River with Skaters	Oil on oak panel	"The impact of Flemish tradition on Dutch painting can be clearly seen in winter landscapes. The first Dutch artist to specialize in these was Hendrick Avercamp, who took the Brueghelian pattern for recording winter's pastimes, and transposed it to the watersides - and ice - of Dutch city canals. His insistence on this fortuitously picked and elaborately developed formula reveals the lasting popularity of the subject. The vogue for winter scenes was stimulated by the ""Little Ice Age"" (lasting approximately from 1550 to 1800), which brought unusually cold winters to the Low Countries.Hendrick Avercamp is by far the best-known seventeenth-century painter of ice scenes. The present painting is one of his rare works on round panel, a format seldom used for landscapes in the Northern Netherlands in the early seventeenth century."
./images/2602.jpg	AYALA, Josefa de	Holy Family with the Infant St John the Baptist, St Elizabeth and Angels	Oil on copper	This painting demonstrates the painter's mature technique with a miniaturist sense of detail.
./images/2603.jpg	AYALA, Josefa de	The Penitent Magdalene Comforted by Angels	Oil on copper	In this painting the artist beautifully expresses her piety and the deep sense of mysticism that pervades much of her oeuvre. The influence of Francisco de ZurbarÃ¡n can be seen in the painting, which is signed and dated lower left.
./images/2604.jpg	AZEGLIO, Massimo Taparelli, Marquis d'	Arabs on Horseback	Oil on metal plate	Orientalism was a facet of Romanticism, which was very much cherished by a number of French artists, among them Delacroix, whose works appear to have been a source of inspiration for this scene. D'Azeglio, a complex man with many simultaneous interests as a politician, novelist, and painter, depicts here the scene of a violent exchange between a group of Arabs in traditional garb and others whose identities remain unclear. The main focus of attention is on what the artist perceived as the wild, exotic atmosphere of northern Africa.
./images/2608.jpg	BABUREN, Dirck van	The Capture of Christ with the Malchus Episode	Oil on canvas	This painting is one of Baburen's rare nocturnal scenes, inspired, in part, byCaravaggio's Taking of Christ.Unlike his Utrecht compatriot Gerrit van Honthorst, who specialised in nocturnal scenes with artificial illumination, Baburen, like Caravaggio, preferred strong patterns of natural daylight.
./images/2609.jpg	BABUREN, Dirck van	Christ Washing the Apostles Feet	Oil on canvas	Baburen's broadly narrative Christ Washing the Apostles Feet typifies the Utrecht School formulaic, stages approach. St Peter's pose, as he protests that Christ should not lower himself to such a humble role, anticipates the violently active figures Bernini sculpted on some of his Roman fountain bases.
./images/2610.jpg	BABUREN, Dirck van	The Entombment of Christ	Oil on canvas	Upon completing his training, Dirck van Baburen travelled to Italy to supplement his education. He and his colleague David de Haen are documented as lodging at two different addresses in 1619-20. They worked together on the decoration of the PietÃ  Chapel in San Pietro in Montorio in Rome. The Entombment of Christ is an autograph  replica of Van Baburen's original which is still in situ in the PietÃ  Chapel.The painting was commissioned by Pietro Cussida, a wealthy Spanish diplomat. The frame of the present painting is original,  most likely from Spain.
./images/2612.jpg	BABUREN, Dirck van	Man Playing a Jew's Harp	Oil on canvas	The representation of popular music, played mainly in the street and featuring instruments which were typical of this type of music, appeared in Rome in the 1620s emerging from Flemish and French painting. The most important examples of this genre include the very early Man Playing a Jew's Harp by Baburen.
./images/2613.jpg	BABUREN, Dirck van	The Procuress	Oil on canvas	From the end of the 1620s paintings containing a clear allusion to sensuality and sexuality increased. Such allusions had been present in an embryonic stage in sixteenth-century Venetian painting. But the authors of these seventeenth-century paintings were not Italian - Italians were evidently inhibited by the Catholic Church's view of morality. Once Netherlandish artists returned to the Low Countries they developed a particular interest in scenes which combined seduction and music. The success of this combination is demonstrated by the sheer number of paintings that have survived.Baburen's painting is an example of this new genre, Honthorst'sProcuressbeing another.
./images/2614.jpg	BABUREN, Dirck van	Prometheus Being Chained by Vulcan	Oil on canvas	With Mercury looking on with amusement, Vulcan the god of fire is chaining Prometheus to a rock. The eagle which is to devour his liver every day - Prometheus' punishment for stealing fire from the gods and giving it to mankind - is hovering ominously in a corner. In this mythological scene, Van Baburen shows himself to be a true Caravaggist, with contrasts of light and shade, dramatic expressions and unidealized people with sun-tanned hands and faces.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 17 minutes):Karl Goldmark: Prometheus Bound, overture op.38
./images/2615.jpg	BABUREN, Dirck van	St Sebastian Attended by St Irene and Her Maid	Oil on canvas	This painting exhibits Caravaggesque tendencies: the artist creates the scene with a strong and artificial chiaroscuro which lights up the body of St Sebastian and the upper bodies of St Irene and her maid, leaving the rest of the pictorial plane in shadow. Only in the foreground can we make out the slain saint's armour.
./images/2619.jpg	BACCHIACCA	Baptism of Christ	Gum tempera on wood	This painting was executed by Bacchiacca in his early period when he was under the influence of his teacher Perugino. In his Baptism of Christ Bacchiacca followedPerugino's model.
./images/2620.jpg	BACCHIACCA	Baptism of Christ with Saints	Panel	Perugino's docile style deeply affected less talented painters like Bacchiacca (who had probably been a Perugino pupil). It is apparent in this late work by Bacchiacca.
./images/2621.jpg	BACCHIACCA	Baptism of Christ	Oil on poplar panel	This representation of Baptism is a fine example from Bacchiacca's early maturity. Though still influenced at this time by Perugino, his master, this painting demonstrates the increasing individuality of the young Florentine, particularly in its use of colour which lends the overall effect a freshness that to the contemporary spectator must have seemed overtly modern.
./images/2622.jpg	BACCHIACCA	Deposition	Oil on wood	Bachiacca belongs to that group of minor artists, of popular temperament and background, part-craftsmen, part-artists, free bizarre spirits in the best Florentine tradition, who in the full flowering of the sixteenth century somehow succeeded in prolonging the naturalistic tradition of Tuscan art.This work, however youthful, shows the interest which the artist nurtured for the painting of landscape. The whole composition - besides being balanced and almost symmetrically divided by the ladders, the crosses and the group of figures - is in fact set in a rural landscape which serves not only as a background to the scene, but is the natural continuation and development of the grassy terrain in the foreground.
./images/2623.jpg	BACCHIACCA	Scenes from the Story of Joseph: Joseph Sold by His Brethren	Oil on wood transferred to canvas	This painting belongs to a series of six Scenes from the Story of Joseph painted by Bachiacca for the wedding chamber of the Florentine Pier Francesco Borgherini, who married Maddalena Acciaiuoli in 1515. Four of the six panels are in the Galleria Borghese, while the other two (Joseph Makes Himself Known to His Brethren and The Second Visit of His Brethren to Egypt) are in the National Gallery in London. Other painters (Andrea del Sarto, Francesco Granacci and Pontormo) also contributed to this commission with works devoted to the same figure from the Old Testament. The pictures were used to decorate the furniture of the chamber.Stylistically, the influence of Northern European painting and engraving (in particular Altdorfer and Lucas van Leyden), is evident in the strong chiaroscuro of the figures, the styles of their dress and the landscape.The scenes from the story of Joseph, son of Jacob, were popular subjects in religious painting, partly because the patriarch was considered a prefiguration of Christ. Despite the presence of the same figures, recognizable by their features and the clothes they are wearing, the identification of the episodes from the Bible story, often combined in a single panel, is controversial.

Four of the six panels are in the Galleria Borghese, while the other two (Joseph Makes Himself Known to His Brethren and The Second Visit of His Brethren to Egypt) are in the National Gallery in London.
./images/2630.jpg	BACCHIACCA	Madonna with Child, St Elisabeth and the Infant St John the Baptist	Oil on wood	The painting is based on an engraving by the Bolognese Marcantonio Raimondi. The engraving itself is a copy of theMadonna del divino amore(Museo del Capodimonte, Naples) executed in Raphael's workshop by Giovanni Francesco Penni.
./images/2631.jpg	BACCHIACCA	The Preaching of Saint John the Baptist	Oil on wood	This painting of the eclectic artist shows the strong influence of Perugino. The work was restored in 1955-60.
./images/2633.jpg	BACCHIACCA	Woman with a Cat	Oil on poplar	This casual small picture of a woman holding a cat shows the Renaissance fondness for exotic pets; women were also depicted with squirrels and rabbits close to hand.
./images/2636.jpg	BACICCIO	Nave vault	Fresco	The fresco on the nave vault depicts the Apotheosis of the Franciscan Order. Baciccio's painting in the centre aisle of Santi Apostoli was partly executed by assistants of the aged painter, however, in its balanced coordination of painting and sculptural decor with the architectural divisions of the vault, the decoration of Santi Apostoli is one of the most ambitious and successful Roman creations of the early eighteenth century.
./images/2637.jpg	BACICCIO	Apotheosis of the Franciscan Order	Fresco	Pietro da Cortona's illusionistic effects were taken to extremes by the religious decorators of the second half of the 17th century. Baciccio and Andrea Pozzo were the most successful among them. Bacciccio's masterpiece was the painted ceiling in the Church of Il GesÃ¹ in Rome.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 33 minutes):Michael Haydn: St Francis Mass
./images/2638.jpg	BACICCIO	Apotheosis of St Ignatius	Oil on canvas	This small oil painting showing the Apotheosis of St Ignatius, the founder of the Jesuit order, is a bozzetto - a preparatory sketch for the fresco Baciccio executed for the vaulting of the left transept of the order's principal church of Il GesÃ¹ in Rome. The bozzetto differs from the fresco only in a few of the angel figures and in the use of stronger colours. Although the apotheosis of the saint has a firm place in the overall ecclesiastical programme of the church, from which it cannot be dissociated, this oil study is nevertheless an independent painting, executed with greater care than one might expect of a sketch.The saint is carried heavenwards by a group of music-making, flower-strewing angels that are inebriated with joy. His arms spread wide, he soars towards a golden stream of light that is breaking through from the depths of the heavens. Baciccio does not treat this supernatural triumphal procession as a transcendental vision, but as a real occurrence. The body of the saint and the angels are not transcended by light, but are sculpturally tangible, and in its earthly corporeality, the painting mediates between the world of the spectator and the light whose source remains invisible to us, but which is perceptible in the figure of the saint.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 4 minutes):Giuseppe Aldrovandini: Sonata in D Major for two trumpets, strings and basso continuo
./images/2640.jpg	BACICCIO	Portrait of Gian Lorenzo Bernini	Oil on canvas	This painting has been connected to a drawing at Windsor dated 1665, evidence which led to date the painting to that year. The preparatory design for the portrait is a drawing at the Palazzo Bianco in Genoa: a drawing derived from it is conserved at Weimar.First considered a self-portrait of Bernini, the painting was only later given to Baciccio. Gaulli carried out several other portraits of Bernini, his teacher and friend. One example, coming from the Altieri collection, dates to around 1673. Another version, once belonging to Queen Christina of Sweden, was in the Geymuller collection. The first Gaulli portrait of Bernini was executed some time before Christmas, 1669, as it is mentioned in a dated letter from Rangoni to the Duke of Modena.

./images/2644.jpg	BACICCIO	Nave vault	Fresco	The fresco on the nave vault represents the Triumph of the Name of Jesus.In Baroque churches, in addition to the choir, the nave vaults, transept chapels, and cupola (if present) offered large and attractive surfaces for painting. Although fictive openings in ceilings and vaults had already been created in painting in the sixteenth century, permitting vivid views of events taking place in heaven, the heavenly visions of the seventeenth century take on a new quality, scale, and intensity. The supreme example is the ceiling composition executed by Baciccio (Giovanni Battista Gaulli) in Il GesÃ¹, the most spectacular of a fresco program encompassing virtually the entire church that Baciccio worked on for thirteen years (1672-85). In earlier examples the architecture served as the framing for the pictures, in Il GesÃ¹ the relationship between architecture and painting was redefined: painting and decoration are confined to those portions of the church structure of greatest symbolic importance.
./images/2645.jpg	BACICCIO	Adoration of the Name of Jesus	Fresco	Some key aspects of Pietro da Cortona's ceiling in the Roman church of  Santa Maria in Vallicella were brought to their extreme consequences by Baciccio in the ceiling of the nave of il GesÃ¹. The Genoese painter came to Rome in 1660 and he soon became familiar with Bernini and his scholars. The design of the ceiling was suggested by Bernini, who had always been a supporter of combining architecture, sculpture and painting to impress the viewer. Here too we have a painting included in a cornice supported by stucco angels on a background of gilded decoration; and the painting is clearly divided into two parts, but the overall effect is much more dramatic.
./images/2646.jpg	BACICCIO	Cupola decoration	Fresco	The picture shows the cupola, pendentives, transept vault, and antechoir of the church of Il GesÃ¹ in Rome.In Baroque churches, in addition to the choir, the nave vaults, transept chapels, and cupola (if present) offered large and attractive surfaces for painting.

./images/2647.jpg	BACICCIO	Cardinal Leopoldo de' Medici	Oil on canvas	Leopoldo (1617-1675) was one of the great Medici collectors. It is estimated that over his lifetime he acquired 730 paintings, 11.247 drawings, nearly 7.000 medals, and some 800 pieces of Asian porcelain.
./images/2648.jpg	BACICCIO	The PietÃÂ  (Mary Lamenting the Dead Christ)	Oil on canvas	"The canvas is identifiable as the ""Dead Christ in the arms of the weeping Virgin with two little angels"", for which the painter received payment on May 25, 1667. The painting was carried out for Cardinal Flavio Chigi, along with another canvas of the Assumption of the Virgin. It is a fundamental work for the career of Gaulli, and looks back to the famous PietÃ  of Annibale Carracci. Gaulli, however, translates the carracciesque language to achieve one of the highest examples of ""baroque classicism"". His synthesis also shows the influence of Van Dyck's art."
./images/2649.jpg	BACICCIO	Portrait of a Lady	Oil on canvas	This portrayal of a lady, head and shoulders, is an excellent example of Baciccio's portraiture style. Noteworrthy is the unusual position of the hand, which arches from the wrist, the fingers with long and supple and the smallest extended upwards. It is in fact a quotation from the sculptor Gian Lorenzo Bernini: this gesture was adopted for thefigure of Truthfrom the funeral monument to Alessandro VII in Saint Peter's, Rome.

Andrea al Quirinale, erected for the novitiate of the Society of Jesus. The altarpiece was set in place in July 1676.Lying outstretched on a palliasse in the right foreground, Saint Francis Xavier is depicted as clasping a crucifix to his breast and surmounted by angels and cherubim who, among the clouds, are assisting at his lonely agony.
./images/2652.jpg	BACICCIO	The Three Maries at the Empty Sepulchre	Oil on canvas	"ALongside Carlo Maratti, Baciccio was considered one of the leading figures of the Roman Late Baroque. Excelling as portraitist and fresco painter, he also painted majestic altarpieces and refined canvases for private galleries.The present painting emblematically expresses the main stylistic elements of the artist in the 1680s who was at the height of his success following his magnificent work at the church of the GesÃ¹. We find the painter's full embracement of Bernini's language, not only in the focus on ""sculptured painting"", typical of the Roman Baroque, but also his adoption of the figurative types of this milieu. The luminous, shimmering palette reflects Baciccio's late evolution towards eighteenth-century painting, of which he was one of the prime forerunners."
./images/2653.jpg	BACKER, Jacob Adriaensz.	Granida and Daifilo	Oil on canvas	Granida and Daifilo were lovers from the Dutch pastoral play Granida (1605) by Pieter Hooft. Granida, the daughter of an eastern king, betrothed to Prince Tisiphernes, lost her way while out hunting. She came upon a shepherd Daifilo and his mistress Dorilea who had just quarrelled. Daifilo fetched water for the princess to drink and fell in love with her. He followed her to court and, after several turns in the story, they fled to the woods together to live a pastoral life. Daifilo was taken prisoner by one of Granida's several suitors. They were finally reunited after the intervention of Tisiphernes who yielded his claim to her. The play set a fashion for pastoral idyll in the Netherlands and long remained popular.

Among his creations were four silver salt cellars in the shape of boys with shells on their heads. In this oval painting Jacob Backer portrayed Lutma withone of these salt cellars.
./images/2656.jpg	BACKER, Jacob Adriaensz.	Portrait of an Old Woman	Oil on wood	This portrait is one of the many paintings formerly attributed to Rembrandt. The attribution to Jacob Backer is not certain, the painting could be a copy of a last portrait by Backer, or the work of a follower executed in the style of Backer.
./images/2657.jpg	BACKER, Jacob Adriaensz.	Portrait of a Woman	Oil on canvas	This portrait representing an old woman in an armchair is one of the many paintings formerly attributed to Rembrandt. The inscription upper right (Rembrandt f. / 1635) is spurious. The painting is now attributed to Jacob Backer based on stylistic comparison with his other paintings.
./images/2658.jpg	BACKER, Jacob Adriaensz.	Portrait of Geertruida Hasselaer	Oil on canvas	This portrait of Geertruida Hasselaer (1624-1696) has been signed in Jacob Backer's customary manner with the monogram JAB. The sitter is depicted standing three quarter length before a curtain, wearing a yellow silk dress and lace chemise, pearls and bonnet, with her right hand holding the train of her dress against her breast. Noteworthy is the way by which the painter captured the lustre and texture of the glowing material.

./images/2660.jpg	BACKER, Jacob Adriaensz.	The Tribute Money	Oil on canvas	Jacob Adriaensz. Backer was influenced by Rembrandt's portraiture and history painting. Like Rembrandt and his pupils, he painted many study heads, so-called tronies, and he often dressed his figures in oriental or fantasy costumes. He rarely painted multi-figure scenes, concentrating instead on a few large figures with compositions closer to Rubens's classical style.The Tribute Money was earlier attributed to Backer's teacher Lambert Jacobsz., however, it is undoubtedly an early work by Backer, which calls to mind paintings by Lambert Jacobsz.
./images/2661.jpg	BACKER, Jacob Adriaensz.	The Tribute Money (detail)	Oil on canvas	In this scene Christ makes clear to the Pharisees that he has no interest in earthly possessions, only in heavenly riches. He points with one hand towards heaven and with the other to the coin held by the Pharisee.This painting has a Baroque movement that reflects the influence of Flemish as well as Italian art.
./images/2662.jpg	BACKER, Jacob Adriaensz.	Venus and Adonis	Oil on canvas	This painting is probably more than a simple history piece. It gave the artist an opportunity to demonstrate his skill as a painter of nudes. Venus, the goddess of love, is seated on a draped platform, gazing up at Adonis and holding his right hand. Adonis stands facing us with his left hand resting lightly on the leg of the love god Cupid. In the foreground we see arrows, a helmet, and a lance. All these objects are emblems of the hunt, as are the two hounds on the left. The pair of turtledoves in the background symbolise the lovers.
./images/2664.jpg	BACKER, Jacob de	The Finding of Moses	Oil on panel	The biblical story (Exodus 2: 3-9) tells of an infant boy left out in a basket on the Nile, who is found by Pharaoh's daughter and brought up by her as her own son, Moses. In the centre of the present representation is the seated figure of the Pharaoh's daughter. Gracefully dressed and wearing a crown, a servant girl stands behind her, fanning her with a canopy of feathers.
./images/2665.jpg	BACKER, Jacob de	Garden of Eden	Oil on oak panel	This highly finished Garden of Eden is attributed to Jacob de Backer, one of the region's most orthodox interpreters of the Italian maniera.
./images/2666.jpg	BACKER, Jacob de	The Last Judgment	Oil on panel	Jacob de Backer was a celebrated specialist of memorial paintings. According to one of his contemporaries, his heavy workload contributed to his own premature death at the age of 30. Antwerp's world-famous printer, Christopher Plantin ordered this painting from Jacob de Backer so that it could be installed in the Antwerp Cathedral as a memorial after his death. This was the custom at the time for leading citizens. We know therefore, that it must have been painted before 1589, the year in which Plantin died. The wings were added later, possibly by another artist in 1591.Christ appears above the clouds in a radiant light to sit in final judgment over humanity. Groups of saints sit among the clouds on either side of him. On the left we see the Virgin Mary and JOhn the Baptist, while Moses with his stone tablets appears on the right. The symbols of the Evangelists appear at Christ's feet, with three trumpet-playing angels below, and lower still, two angels who enact the sentence of the divine court. One drives the damned souls into hell with his sword, eagerly assisted by the demons that grab at the unfortunate condemned, while the other points the way to heaven. On the surface of the earth, other angels guide the blessed souls to paradise.Plantin is shown in the left wing, kneeling at a prie-dieu. He is accompanied by his young son, also called Christopher. The boy died young, as is indicated by the little red cross above his head. St Christopher, with the Infant Christ on his shoulders, stands by a wide river with a town on the opposite bank. The other wings shows Jeanne RiviÃ¨re, Plantin's wife, praying with her six daughters - one of whom also died young. Her patron saint, John the Baptist, stands to the rear of the group.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 8 minutes):Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart: Requiem K 626: Dies irae
./images/2668.jpg	BACKHUYSEN, Ludolf	Ships in Distress off a Rocky Coast	Oil on canvas	Backhuysen is the last representative of the great tradition of Dutch marine painting; eighteenth-century Dutch artists did much less of consequence in this category than in the others they practised.Backhuysen was born in Emden, Germany, and came to Amsterdam around the middle of the century where he remained for the rest of his life. His high-placed patrons include the burgomasters of Amsterdam, the Archduke of Tuscany, Czar Peter the Great, and various German princes. He is best known for his stormy scenes. Houbraken writes that when a storm threatened he sometime went by boat 'to the mouth of the Sea, in order to observe the crash of the Seawater under these conditions'.His Ships in Distress off a Rocky Coast shows the chilling drama he can bring to the theme. The large cargo ship in the centre is managing to make way along the perilous coast, while on the right, two vessels are in even greater danger.Later his storms become melodramatic, his chiaroscuro effects exaggerated, and his gigantic waves rather schematic and glass-like.
./images/2669.jpg	BACKHUYSEN, Ludolf	Ships in Distress in a Raging Storm	Oil on canvas	The violence of nature is the main focus of Backhuysen's painting. He concentrated on the high waves lashing against the ships The frigate in the foreground attempts to lower her sails before it is too late. Two masts of the ship on the left have nearly been swept overboard. The wild sea finds its echo in the racing clouds. One cannot be certain these ships will reach the coast safely.The painter did not paint an actual shipwreck, the painting is an illustration of a severe storm at sea.
./images/2670.jpg	BACKHUYSEN, Ludolf	Shipping by the Dutch Coast	Oil on canvas	The present canvas shows a fishing fleet off the Dutch coast navigating choppy waters. In the far background, a Dutch man-o'war can be seen.The painting is monogrammed on the barrel lower right: 'L.B.'
./images/2671.jpg	BACKHUYSEN, Ludolf	Small Dutch Vessels	Oil on canvas	The painting depicts small Dutch vessels in breezy coastal waters, a harbour beyond.
./images/2672.jpg	BACKHUYSEN, Ludolf	Ships in a Stiff Breeze	Oil on canvas	In this balanced composition we see to the right a kaag (a coastal transport vessel). At the extreme left is a fluyt, the most successful trading vessel. Beyond the heavily armed two-decker warship in the centre is a wijdschip, and in the foreground, animated by a standing seaman and in the process of heading downwind, is a weyschuit.
./images/2673.jpg	BACKHUYSEN, Ludolf	Ships Running Aground in a Storm	Oil on canvas	While Dutch primacy in merchant shipping offered high rewards, its risks were equally significant. On their long journeys to the Mediterranean, the New World, Africa, and the East, merchant vessels were perennially endangered by warfare, piracy, treacherous shores, and storms. Several painters, most dramatically Ludolf Backhuysen, specialized in ships adrift in tempests.Backhuysen executed this painting (his largest surviving one) as if he were observing the disaster in the midst of the roiling seas, thus engaging beholders in the unfolding tragedy, encouraging them to empathize with the ships and their crews and to contemplate the powers of God, beyond full comprehension.But even as such paintings acknowledge the fragility of Dutch seaborne success, their distant shafts of sunlight usually hold out hope for reversals of misfortune. A brighter future may still save Backhuysen's ship at left, its Dutch flag unfurled against lightening skies. Collectors occasionally hung a tempest painting opposite a sunny shipping scene, implying that the power of God and nature, whether terrifying or benevolent, is always magnificent.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 10 minutes):Antonio Vivaldi: Concerto in E flat major RV 253 op. 8 No. 5  (Storm at sea)

./images/2681.jpg	BACKHUYSEN, Ludolf	View from the Nieuwe Maas River towards the City of Vlaardingen	Oil on canvas	Backhuysen depicted the city of Vlaardingen on various occasions. The present work is set on the Nieuwe Maas River, looking towards the city of Vlaardingen with a view of the Old Town Hall (built in 1650), the Grote Kerk and the harbour.
./images/2685.jpg	BADALOCCHIO, Sisto	The Entombment of Christ	Oil on canvas	The important Entombment of Christ dating from the first decade of the 17th century is attributed to Sisto Badalocchio. Here human participation in the event has become the main focus. A comparison with Raphael's Deposition (also in the Borghese Gallery), which inspired it, reveals how the painter insisted on the emotions as reflected in natural movements, and was influenced both by DÃ¼rer's prints and antique sculpture.
./images/2686.jpg	BADALOCCHIO, Sisto	The Holy Family	Oil on panel	Badalocchio, who was born in Parma, probably trained in the Carracci academy in Bologna, and then worked with Agostino Carracci in the service of Ranuccio Farnese in Parma. On Agostino's death he went, with Giovanni Lanfranco, to Rome to work as an assistant of Annibale on the walls of the Galleria Farnese. On Annibale's death in 1609, Badalocchio returned to his native city. His artistic personality was relatively obscure until the 1950s, in part because of his dependence on Annibale's example.The influences of both Parma and Rome are evident in this picture. The Virgin rests against a wall, apparently pausing during the flight into Egypt, cradling the infant Christ, while St Joseph keeps watch. A notable feature is the exquisite still-life of a basket of fruit.The picture was first recorded in the Farnese collection, where, in 1653, it was attributed to Lanfranco. Subsequently, it was attributed to Ludovico Carracci, and it was only in 1958 that the correct attribution to Badalocchio was proposed. The monumentality of form and the intimate use of expression owe much to Annibale's teaching, as does the classical landscape which frames the composition. In these respects the picture can be compared with Albani's contemporary Rest on the Flight. However, the handling of colour and light suggest that Badalocchio was also influenced by the art of Parma, especially that of Correggio and Bartolomeo Schedoni (then court painter to Ranuccio Farnese), suggesting that it was executed shortly after his departure from Rome. A copy of this painting, extended at the left to include two angels, once hung alongside it in the Farnese collection in Rome, and is now in the Museo di Capodimonte in Naples.
./images/2687.jpg	BADALOCCHIO, Sisto	Mars and Venus	Oil on canvas	This painter from Parma was the author of altarpieces as well as fresco decorations in both Rome and Parma. Nevertheless, he was especially esteemed for gallery paintings, such as the present canvas. While three 'amorini' are busy disarming him, Mars futilely attempts to resist the enticement of Venus, lying on a precious bed; a pleasant landscape opens up in the background.The painting seems to have been quite famous, judging from the existence of an old copy which documents the original format of the work, altered during the eighteenth century.
./images/2688.jpg	BADALOCCHIO, Sisto	Susanna and the Elders	Oil on canvas	The theme of Susanna and the Elders was very well-known in Venice by the end of the sixteenth century, but not in Rome. It seems likely that its increased popularity in the Eternal City was the direct result of Annibale Carracci and his school. Annibale had made a print of Susanna and the Elders before he left Bologna, and in Rome he took up the theme again in a lost painting described by Bellori. Sisto Badalocchio's monumental figures are similar to those in Annibale's print, although Susanna is more clearly derived from antique examples of the Crouching Venus. The normal garden setting and fountain in which Susanna bathes have been reduced to the bare minimum; only a few trees and a classical pedestal suggest the rest. Thus the figures, which are close to life-size, have a commanding psychological presence and the palpability of Susanna's semi-nude body seems all the more sexually arousing.Because of the inscription 'A.CAR.BON.F.', the picture has been variously attributed to Annibale, Agostino, and Antonio Carracci. However, none of these artists is known to have signed works solely with the initial `A'. By 1657, when the picture was recorded in the collection of Donna Olimpia Aldobrandini, it had already been taken off its stretcher, strongly suggesting that it was not by an artist of Annibale's stature (or perhaps that the subject was considered too provocative). The signature was first recorded in the nineteenth century and technical evidence suggests that it floats on the surface. It was therefore probably added at a later date to enhance the value of the painting.In 1602 Badalocchio was sent by the Duke of Parma to study with Annibale in Rome, where he remained until the master's death in 1609. His Roman works, such as the Susanna and the Hartford Holy Family, unite the grandeur of Annibale's style with a pictorial richness of colour and light that reflects Badalocchio's Emilian background. The plump, round faces and relief-like effect of the drapery's sinuous folds are similar in both pictures. The compact grouping of the figures around a recessive diagonal is also more characteristic of Badalocchio than of any of the members of the Carracci family.
./images/2689.jpg	BAEGERT, Derick	The Bearing of the Cross	Oil on panel	In the late fifteenth century, Wesel in the Lower Rhine was an important art centre, as demonstrated with the recently discovered oeuvre of Derick Baegert. His Bearing of the Cross does not merely describe Christ on the road to Calvary, but it evokes metaphorical associations through elaboration of the narrative. Without violating the meaning of the Gospel text, the painting transcends literal interpretation. In continuous narrative, the painting elicits multiple associations. In the background, Christ can be witnessed already hanging on the cross, as his betrayer Judas commit suicide from a nearby tree.
./images/2690.jpg	BAEGERT, Derick	Christ Carrying the Cross and Veronica with the Sudarium	Oil on panel	The present composition - composed of two panels - was originally part of a large Crucifixion, which at some point in the past was broken up into smaller panels. Although five of these have been reunited in the Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection, most of the composition is still missing.The painting reveals a great interest in narrative and is built up through the accumulation of numerous different elements and incidents, whereby various episodes from the Passion take place at the same time: in the middle ground, Christ bearing the Cross takes the cloth which St Veronica offers Him. Behind this scene we see a hanged man, probably the traitor Judas. The various figures in the procession behind Christ are depicted in great detail, and the anecdotal nature of the painting is obvious in the figure who makes a mocking face at the Virgin and her followers.

Ideal evocations of fashionable seventeenth-century ""collector connoisseurship"", they were also related to the art market, with which Cornelius de Braeilleur was familiar: his father and his uncle were both dealers. here a large residence holds a collection of paintings and several curios (shell, scientific instruments, China porcelain) arranged on a table. A mythological painting in the Italian style is shown on an easel to potential buyers."

Hans Jordaens and Cornelis de Baellieur succeeded him in this metier. The depictions of art and curiosity cabinets show galleries owned by well-known collectors, but usually the owners were anonymous or fictive.The gallery interior in this picture was painted by Jordaens, the figures by Baellieur. The principal paintings depicted, ""King Midas' Feast"" and the ""Allegory of Painting"", were most probably executed by Francken himself."

This cost the De Witt brothers, Johan and Cornelis, their lives. De Baen's painting depicts their corpses hanging on the Groene Zoodje on the Vijverberg in The Hague. Johan de Witt was the Pensionary (the factual leader) of Holland, the most powerful province. He was assassinated by a carefully organized lynch ""mob"" after visiting his brother Cornelis de Witt in prison. He was decoyed into this trap by a forged letter."

It is one of three works combining the motifs of both fruit and flower displays and enlivened by numerous insects, all of which bear a similar monogram.
./images/2700.jpg	BAERTSOEN, Albert	Ghent, Evening	Oil on canvas	As a result of their approach to Impressionism, Belgian artists occasionally juxtaposed native Flemish styles with imported Impressionist styles derived from the French. The more Flemish version was to be found in the work Baertsoen, one of whose finest paintings was Ghent, Evening.
./images/2708.jpg	BAGLIONE, Cesare	Interior view	Fresco	The decoration of this room represents depictions of the history of the Rossi family from 1199 to to 1542. It is the work of Cesare Baglione, Jacopo Bertoia, and others.The decoration of large halls with the deeds of the nobility and their ancestors was intended to inspire the viewer's admiration. The depiction of such events from the recent past has a long tradition. Most such cycles in the first half of the sixteenth century, however, are dedicated to a single person or event. By contrast, from the middle of the century onward this genre was increasingly devoted to the representation of dynasties.Pragmatic reasons were behind the success of the idea, derived from Raphael and his workshop, of making mural painting that simulated tapestries. Sometimes the possibility of pulling the tapestries aside was used to integrate doors or windows into the decoration. The popularity of the tapestry motif was not based solely on formal concerns, however. It imitated the most splendid and expensive wall decoration of all, which cost many times more than a fresco painting and could be afforded by very few. Hence, particularly in large halls like those in San Secondo, this motif also contributed to their significance and emphasized the importance of the thing depicted - in this case the deeds of the family in question.
./images/2709.jpg	BAGLIONE, Cesare	Grotesques with Imaginary Landscapes	Fresco	Some of the Roman paintings found in the Domus Aurea and elsewhere correspond quite precisely what Vasari and others determined to be the typical features of grotesques. These paintings inspired several ceiling designs 'all'antica' in the first part of the sixteenth century. The desire to revive not only the forms of ancient Roman architecture but also their decoration may help to explain the success of these paintings. In particular, Raphael and the specialist in his workshop, who mastered the genre completely, helped the grotesque style to spread quickly in Rome. This style enjoyed a long-lasting success, which can still be demonstrated even after mid-century. Nevertheless, quite early on the genre developed independently and distanced itself increasingly from ancient models. Later grotesques differed from antique iconography in every respect and retain only the principle of an absurd and paradoxical combination of varied buildings, figures, animals, and plants that Vitruvius criticized.The fresco decoration in the Rocca dei Rossi is an example of the later grotesques. Rocca dei Rossi is a castle located in San Secondo Parmense, northern Italy. It was begun in 1466 on land donated to Giacomo Rossi, a member of one of the most prestigious families in Parma. The stronghold was later turned into a luxurious manor including many beautiful frescoes by the best local artists of the 16th century.
./images/2710.jpg	BAGLIONE, Cesare	Grotesques	Fresco	Another example of the later grotesques is in Soragna. Just how much this genre was appreciated  can be seen from the fact that rooms and even large halls were entirely decorated with grotesques - mostly in combination with fantastic landscapes.Soragna is a town in the province of Parma. The Rocca (fortress) was built in 1385 by the Marchesi Bonifacio and Antonio Lupi.
./images/2711.jpg	BAGLIONE, Giovanni	Clio	Oil on canvas	This painting is one of a series of ten, representing the Muses by Giovanni Baglione. The paintings were received by Marie de' Medici.
./images/2712.jpg	BAGLIONE, Giovanni	The Dream of St Joseph	Oil on canvas	This altarpiece is a characteristic example of the colourful late Mannerism of Roman art which was soon to be radically altered by Caravaggio's revolutionary new style. It was probably commissioned by the Santacroce family in Rome.
./images/2714.jpg	BAGLIONE, Giovanni	Hercules at the Crossroads	Oil on canvas	Hercules in Greek mythology is the personification of physical strength and courage. Hercules at the crossroad (the choice of Hercules) is an allegory which depicts the hero choosing between the figures who personify Virtue and Vice, each of whom invites him to follow her. He chose the former. In this painting Virtue take the form of Minerva, the goddess of wisdom and Hercules' mentor. She wears armour.
./images/2715.jpg	BAGLIONE, Giovanni	St John the Baptist in the Wilderness	Oil on canvas	Baglione, a colleague and rival of Caravaggio, explored the subject of St John the Baptist in the Wilderness as early as 1600 and he continued to paint images of St John the Baptist throughout his long and productive career.The probable model for the present version could beCaravaggio's St John the Baptistin Kansas City.
./images/2717.jpg	BAGLIONE, Giovanni	Heavenly Love and Earthly Love	Oil on canvas	This painting was made in competition withCaravaggio's Amor Victorious,but it is characteristic that Baglione's painting was later considered a Caravaggio.Baglione depicted an angel in full armour, which Orazio Gentileschi had criticized. This angel is shown chastising a boy Cupid, painted in Caravaggio's style, with a sword of light.
./images/2718.jpg	BAGLIONE, Giovanni	Sacred and Profane Love	Oil on canvas	"Baglione painted this canvas, alongside of another version now in Berlin, for the Cardinal Benedetto Giustiniani. The two works follow on the heels of and make reference to Caravaggio's Love Victorious, painted in 1601 for the Marquis Vincenzo Giustiniani.The canvas dates to just before the famous court trial that marked Baglione's definitive split with the circle of his contemporary, Caravaggio: it is thus a document of the phase of Baglione's career in which he most closely approximated Caravaggio's methods. Baglione was originally trained as a painter in the late mannerist style, and was active in major papal commissions at the end of the sixteenth century. He was the first painter to attach himself to the new naturalistic vision of Caravaggio, a style that had its official debut in that painter's work at San Luigi dei Francesi in the Jubilee Year of 1600. While there is no doubt that Baglione modelled the National Gallery picture on Caravaggio's Love Victorious, the artist took a completely new point of view. Uniting the figures to the dark background against which they stand out, he uses an intense and direct spotlighting that creates strong chiaroscuro contrasts. The legacy of late mannerism matrix is evident in both the compositions of the individual figures, above all the attenuated proportions of Sacred Love, and in the rich, complex attire, which departs from Caravaggesque prototypes.Derived from the Psychomachia of Prudentius, the moralizing theme of combat between the vices and the virtues was interpreted by Virgil in ""Omnia vincit Amor"". Later codified by Petrarch, the theme enjoyed a new popularity in the early seventeenth century. The face of the figure of the devil at the left has been identified as a portrait of Caravaggio. This canvas includes a satirical condemnation of both Caravaggio's art and his moral scruples, making what is tantamount to a visual charge of sodomy. Divine Love interrupts a tryst between Cupid and the Devil, who turns toward the viewer in anguished surprise revealing Caravaggio's likeness.The painting is signed and dated: ""IO BAGLIONE/R:F:/1602"""
./images/2719.jpg	BAGLIONE, Giovanni	St Sebastian Healed by an Angel	Oil on canvas	Baglione's tender image of an angel delicately extracting an arrow from St Sebastian's side is indicative of the new emphasis placed on succour and compassion during the post-Tridentine period by the Oratorians and other religious orders. Images of St Sebastian bound to a tree and pierced with arrows had become increasingly popular from the fifteenth century on, partly because they gave artists an excuse to depict the male nude within a religious context. The inclusion of an angel tending the saint's wounds is very rare, but undoubtedly reflects devotional literature that recounted how Christ sent an angel to untie Sebastian and cure his wounds. The angel can also be linked to the contemporary cult of guardian angels, who were believed to take the outward appearance of youthful boys. Similar guardian angels can be found in Caravaggio's Stigmatisation of St Francis (Wadsword Atheneum, Hartford), Orazio Gentileschi's St Francis Supported by an Angel (Museo del Prado, Madrid), and Baglione's own St Francis Comforted by Two Angels (Private collection), which is dated 1601.Baglione's two paintings are among the earliest examples of Caravaggio's influence on another artist. More irritated than flattered by the attention, Caravaggio openly ridiculed Baglione, claiming that he did not know a single painter who would praise him as a good artist. In truth, Baglione did not fully absorb the intricacy of his model. While in the St Sebastian he easily adopted superficial qualities, such as bold, raking light and fleshy, full-lipped faces, the carefully honed emotional depth of Caravaggio's work was beyond his grasp. The picture is listed in the 1724 inventory of Anna Maria Sannesio, the last direct heir of Cardinal Giacomo Sannesio, who had purchased Caravaggio's Conversion of St Paul after it was rejected for the Cerasi Chapel. There is a strong possibility that he was the original owner of Baglione's St Sebastian.
./images/2722.jpg	BAILLY, David	Portrait of a Man	Oil on wood	The sitter of this portrait in unidentified, he is possibly a botanist: the open book in his hands shows two views of a narcissus. The portrait formerly was attributed to Ferdinand Bol, the recent attribution to David Bailly is supported by stylistic considerations and by the similarities to other portraits by Bailly, such as the portrait of Anthony de Wale in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam.
./images/2723.jpg	BAILLY, David	Portrait of Anthony de Wale	Oil on wood	The sitter, holding a book in his right hand, was a professor of theology at the University of Leiden.
./images/2724.jpg	BAILLY, David	Self-Portrait with Vanitas Symbols	Oil on wood	In this vanitas still-life, the border between the two genres of the still-life and the portrait are blurred.On the one hand, there are several portraits (as painting within the painting) forming part of a still-life arrangement on the table. The arrangement includes, among other things, a skull, an extinguished candle, coins, a wine glass on its side, a pocket watch, roses, a pearl necklace, a pipe, books and sculpture. Soap bubbles hover above them as symbols of transience.On the other hand, the entire collection functions as a statement about the young man on the left, whose face displays the typical features of a self-portrait. It may therefore be somewhat irritating that the artist was in fact 67 years old when he painted this picture in 1651.However, the contradiction can be solved when we consider that his current features are shown in the small oval portrait, demonstratively held out towards the viewer - a medium which in itself already documents the transience of life. The youthful artist's face, by contrast, shows Bailly as he was at an earlier stage in his life, more than four decades previously. Thus, by changing the time references of past fiction and present reality, the painting suggests that the young artist is anticipating his future age, which - though part of the present in 1651 - appears to belong to the past, as conveyed through the medium of the portrait. The young man, who appears to be so real within the first-degree reality of the painting, really represents a state of the past.Unlike the repetitive, dull and often schematic topics of Dutch vanitas still-lifes, the misleading time scale in Bailly's painting adds a new dimension to the whole subject.

She was the daughter of Federigo-Ubaldo della Rovere (1604-1648) and Claudia de' Medici. She gave her husband four children, two of which would survive infancy; the future Cosimo III, Tuscany's longest reigning monarch and Francesco Maria, a prince of the Church.She is best known as the last heir of the art collection assembled by her family in Urbino and as the person who, through marriage, passed them on to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany.

The length of the room  is 24 m, the width 11 m and the height 7,5 m. The frescoes are attributed to Cosme Tura, Francesco del Cossa, Baldassare d'Este and Ercole de' Roberti.
./images/2739.jpg	BALDASSARE D' ESTE	Borso d'Este	Tempera on canvas mounted on panel	Borso d'Este (1413-1471) was the ruler of Ferrara for more than two decades. He succeeded his more cultured and intellectual brother Leonello, in 1450. He was made duke of Modena and Reggio by Frederick III in 1452, and in 1471, four months before his death, he was installed as duke of Ferrara.Borso was vain but his interest in portraiture was not merely an expression of vanity: he fully appreciated the usefulness of princely images in promoting his legitimacy and status. His portrait was included in the fresco cycles of his various residences, most memorablyin the Palazzo Schifanoia,as well as on medals, coins, and in individual portraits.After 1469, his half-brother, Baldassare d'Este, became Borso's preferred portraitist. The present portrait by Baldassare shows Borso toward the end of his life, gray-haired and lowly but every bit the proud ruler.
./images/2740.jpg	BALDASSARE D' ESTE	Portrait of a Young Man	Panel	The painter of this picture was previously known as A. F. Master of Ferrara.Baldassare Estense was the natural son of Nicolo III d'Este. In the last centuries this painting was attributed to different painters based on the initials to be found in the lower part of the picture. Since these initials were resolved as A. F(errariensis) P(ixit), the painting was mentioned for a long time as the work of A.F. Master from Ferrara. In the last decades the attribution to Baldassare Estense seems to be final. The identity of the young man on the picture is not established. Constanzo Sforza, Antonio Ordelaffi or somebody from the Fugger family are usually mentioned as possible identification.
./images/2741.jpg	BALDI, Lazzaro	The Baptism of the Crowds	Oil on canvas	As an artist almost exclusively devoted to the largeness of altar paintings (and frescoes), Lazzaro Baldi only rarely worked with small formats. The present painting represents one of the few examples. It is largely indebted to the mature Pietro da Cortona

./images/2746.jpg	BALDOVINETTI, Alessio	Annunciation	Tempera on wood	Faithfully adhering to the Florentine tradition, Alessio Baldovinetti made refined use of a clear, almost sharp line, together with a great curiosity for the tiniest details. In this work, note the slender elegance of the Madonna, whose traditional gesture of reverent surprise at the angel's announcement has been replaced by an almost mannered pose, worthy of some worldly ritual. The artist attempts a perspective view by setting the scene under a portico, thus creating a background plane with the tops of the trees that can be seen above the surrounding wall.
./images/2747.jpg	BALDOVINETTI, Alessio	Madonna and Child with Saints	Tempera on wood	This altarpiece was commissioned to Baldovinetti for the Medici villa of Cafaggiolo. Represented in the painting are, from left to right, Saint Anthony Abbot, Saint Julian, Saint Lawrence, Saint John the Baptist, and Saints Cosmas and Damian. Saint Peter the Martyr (right) and Saint Francis (left) are the kneeling figures.Alessio Baldovinetti, like many other artists of his time, emerged from Beato Angelico's circle. Only apparently open to the innovations of Paolo Uccello and Domenico Veneziano, Baldovinetti actually grasped only some superficial hint of them, as for example in the vivid luminosity of his spaces, the atmospheric transparence discernible in the hyperbolic distances of his landscapes.
./images/2748.jpg	BALDOVINETTI, Alessio	Madonna and Child	Wood	Formerly the painting was attributed to Piero della Francesca whose influence can be observed in the treatment of the landscape background.
./images/2749.jpg	BALDOVINETTI, Alessio	Virgin and Child	Tempera on canvas	This painting is a characteristic example of the genre of Italian Madonna paintings in the fifteenth century. Furthermore, it is one of the earliest surviving Florentine paintings which depict an extensive landscape fading into the distance. This type of landscape background can be traced back to lost prototypes by Jan van Eyck.
./images/2750.jpg	BALDOVINETTI, Alessio	Nativity	Fresco	Baldovinetti's Annunciation is in the atrium of Santissima Annunziata in Florence. His interest in local landscape is evident in the Arno Valley view that he chose as the background of this fresco. In fact he painted only a few portions of the picture in true fresco, and then waited until the plaster had dried so that he could paint 'a secco.' But because the fresco was located in an atrium exposed to winter fogs and even rain, in time the a secco faces, hands, and drapery peeled off, and his underdrawing is now visible. Even so, the painting is impressive in the airy openness of its setting and the view over the expansive Tuscan plain, which is filled with the light of a clear winter day.
./images/2751.jpg	BALDOVINETTI, Alessio	Portrait of a Lady in Yellow (with frame)	Tempera and oil on panel	"In the Quattrocento, painted portraits were usually placed in the ""camere,"" the chambers that were the multipurpose rooms at the heart of household life. The portrait of a woman, attributed to Alesso Baldovinetti, retains its original gold frame, and the inventory of the Tornabuoni palace list that of Giovanna degli Albizzi Tornabuoni as in a gilt frame."
./images/2752.jpg	BALDOVINETTI, Alessio	Portrait of a Lady in Yellow	Tempera and oil on panel	Baldovinetti's profile portrait of an unknown Florentine woman expresses patrician Quattrocento elegance. She is posed in the conventional profile view that is used almost without exception for female portraits until the end of the century, long after male sitters are shownturned toward the observer.
./images/2753.jpg	BALDOVINETTI, Alessio	Annunciation	Panel and fresco	Baldovinetti was chose in 1466 to decorate the walls, lunettes, and spandrels of the burialChapel of the Cardinal of Portugal.The Annunciation is placed over the empty throne that faces the tomb by Antonio Rossellino. The background of cypresses and cedars is painted in fresco, the wall, bench and figures were painted on oak panel. The lily in the centre is carved and gilded.
./images/2754.jpg	BALDRIGHI, Giuseppe	The Family of Philip, Duke of Parma	Oil on canvas	Philip of Spain (1720-1765) was Duke of Parma from 1748 to 1765. He founded the House of Bourbon-Parma, a cadet line of the Spanish branch of the dynasty. He was a son-in-law of Louis XV.The present group portrait shows the Duke and his wife Louise Elisabeth of France with their daughter Isabella of Parma (later wife of Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor), and their younger children Ferdinand, the later Ferdinand I of Parma and Maria Luisa (later Queen of Spain).The girl is keeping her brother's miniature sword away from him. Portrayed in profile on the right is the children's gouvernante, Marie Catherine de Bassecourt.
./images/2755.jpg	BALDRIGHI, Giuseppe	Portrait of Antonio Ghedini and his Family	Oil on canvas	Antonio Ghedini from Parma was an official cloth merchant to the Bourbon court. As befits the family of a leading cloth merchant, the Ghedini family are suitably modishly attired: his wife wears a brocaded silk open robe with foliate stripes, salmon-pink furbelows and matching stomacher.Formerly the portrait had been ascribed to the French court painter Louis Michel van Loo. The confusion is perhaps understandable, for Baldrighi's style was formed in Paris, where the Duke's minister Guillaume du Tillot had sent him for training.
./images/2757.jpg	BALDUCCI, Giovanni	Adoration of the Shepherds	Oil on copper	An altarpiece of the same subject by Giovanni Balducci, dating from 1592, is recorded in the church of San Francesco, Volterra.
./images/2758.jpg	BALDUCCI, Giovanni	Diana and Actaeon	Oil on copper	In this painting, the facial types of Diana's devotees, with their neat, pointed noses and small, thin lipped mouths are typical of Giovanni Balducci, the painter favoured by Cardinal Alessandro de' Medici (later Pope Leo XI).
./images/2759.jpg	BALDUCCI, Matteo	Diana and Actaeon	Panel	This panel, probably a birth salver (a tray used for carrying gifts to a woman who had given birth), is an amusing rendition of the story taken from Ovid's Metamorphoses. The group of Diana and the bathing nymphs is an adaptation of the antique Three Graces, which was already displayed in the Piccolomini Library in Balducci's day.
./images/2762.jpg	BALDUNG GRIEN, Hans	Adam and Eve	Oil on wood	Hans Baldung Grien was probably the greatest and the most talented of DÃ¼rer's pupils, his works being expressions of both an artistic and spiritual intensity. He exulted particularly in his interest for the female nude, a subject which he treated several times and portrayed in a dramatic confrontation death and therefore with the frailty of the body, thus offering up a macabre interpretation of the classical theme of vanitas.The two figures are given solidity, and cultures, gracious expressions emerge from their faces, thus revealing the painter's interest for Italian Renaissance art. Baldung Grien was in fact a man of high culture; born into an educated family, he became the most authoritative exponent of the humanistic circle in Strasbourg, belonged to the cultural aristocracy and throughout his life had contacts with intellectuals and thinkers.
./images/2763.jpg	BALDUNG GRIEN, Hans	Adam and Eve	Oil on panel	Vigorous lines, clear and plastic forms and bold presentation are the characteristic features of the two companion-pieces Adam and Eve. The paintings represent the life-size figures of Adam and Eve from the scene of the Fall. They appear to have belonged to a series consisting of four nudes, and it is recorded that in 1641 four paintings by Hans Baldung, representing Adam, Eve, Judith and Venus, found their way from Strasbourg into the possession of a Basel merchant. The full-length Judith, now in the Germanisches Museum in Nuremberg, and the Venus in the Kroller-Muller Museum at Otterlo are panels of the same structure and dimensions as the pictures in Budapest and, since the former is dated 1524, it may be assumed that the whole series, including the two pictures in Budapest, was painted in that year.The artist created a strong contrast between the figures Adam and Eve. The characteristic marked contours of Adam manisfest the drawing skills of the artist. The paintings show the influence of DÃ¼rer.

./images/2769.jpg	BALDUNG GRIEN, Hans	Adam and Eve	Oil on panel	This brilliantly executed painting displays one of Baldung's specialities - the treatment of the nude, particularly the female nude. The subject of this painting is original sin, which is conveyed not just through the use of the traditional symbols - the serpent and the apple - but also by Adam's eloquent pose, holding Eve firmly and possessively with a look that leaves nothing to the imagination.
./images/2770.jpg	BALDUNG GRIEN, Hans	Three Ages of the Woman and the Death	Oil on limewood	Baldung's experiments with the macabre were initiated early in Strasbourg, 1508-12, before his sojourn in Freiburg. One of these is the Three Ages of the Woman and the Death. in which the portrayals of age have a sinister character and a mannered virtuosity.
./images/2771.jpg	BALDUNG GRIEN, Hans	Death and the Maiden	Oil on panel	In this painting a voluptuous young maiden turns to receive the kiss of her lover, only to discover, to her horror, Death. The skeletal figure gently holds her head, a gesture that belies the finality of his impending bite. His patches of wispy hair and rotting skin mock her flowing tresses and supple flesh. The dark setting, unnoticed at first, is a cemetery as she stands on a gravestone, perhaps her own. This Vanitas picture (an image that alludes to the transience of life) typifies Baldung's predilection for erotically charged twists to more conventional themes, such as the Dance of Death.
./images/2772.jpg	BALDUNG GRIEN, Hans	Death and the Maiden	Oil on panel	"In the later version of the theme by Baldung, the awaited lover of the maiden turns out to be a grimacing Death, who embraces her with its bony fingers pulling at her hair, a reminder that her beauty will soon vanish, as the ominous inscription above her head warns: ""This is your end."""
./images/2773.jpg	BALDUNG GRIEN, Hans	The Seven Ages of Woman	Oil on oak-wood	Picturing the different ages of men and women was a favourite subject of the Renaissance artists, as the symbol of evanescence. (See e.g. the painting of Titian.)

./images/2777.jpg	BALDUNG GRIEN, Hans	Three Ages of Man	Oil on panel	Hand Baldung Grien, DÃ¼rer's friend and pupil, gave graphic expression to the profound notion, with roots in medieval Germany, that associates feminine youth and beauty with death.
./images/2779.jpg	BALDUNG GRIEN, Hans	Pyramus and Thisbe	Linden panel	This painting depicts the story of Pyramus and Thisbe as Ovid tells in Metamorphoses (4:55-166). The lovers, forbidden by their parents to marry, planned to meet in secret one night beside a spring. Thisbe arrived first but as she waited a lioness, fresh from a kill, came to quench its thirst, its jaws dripping blood. Thisbe fled, in her haste dropping her cloak which the beast proceeded to tear to shreds. When Pyramus arrived and discovered the bloody garment he believed the worst. Blaming himself for his lover's supposed death he plunged his sword into his side. Thisbe returned to find her lover dying and so, taking his sword, threw herself upon it. This story became widely popular in post-Renaissance painting.

In the centre The Adoration of the Magi with the donor, Ernst von Wettin, Archbishop of Magdeburg, brother of Emperor Frederic the Wise, is represented. The side panels depict St George and St Maurice, the latter being the patron saint of the Magdeburg archbishopry.The altarpiece was painted for the cathedral of Halle shortly after Baldung left DÃ¼rer's studio.

The left wing depicts St Anne with the Christ Child, the Virgin, and St John the Baptist (National Gallery of Art, Washington), the central panel shows the Mass of St Gregory (Museum of Art, Cleveland), and the right wing represents St John on Patmos (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York).The two Johns in the altarpiece are positioned at the extreme left and right edges of the panels, each witnessing a vision, of the Anna Selbdritt (Virgin and Child with St Anne) on the left wing, and of the Virgin of the Apocalypse on the right.

The present painting shows the youthful St John the Evangelist wearing a bright red-orange robe and cloak as he writes the book of Revelation in the codex on his knees. The Virgin, in a vivid turquoise gown, surrounded by a mandorla of clouds, appears to him in a vision.
./images/2787.jpg	BALDUNG GRIEN, Hans	Rest on the Flight to Egypt	Oil on wood	Baldung is noted for representations of the Virgin Mary, in which he combined landscapes, figures, light, and colour with an almost magical serenity. In this painting the artist transformed the religious subject into a springtime excursion to the country.This painting is wholly in the tradition of the Danube school pictures of Cranach and Altdorfer while faintly echoing the types in Schongauer's engravings.
./images/2788.jpg	BALDUNG GRIEN, Hans	The Holy Family in the Open	Tempera on wood	The landscape in this painting is close to those of the Danube School reflecting the romantic character of the alpine foothills. Although it resembles to depictions of the rest during the flight to Egypt, no motifs characteristic for this subject are included in the scene.
./images/2789.jpg	BALDUNG GRIEN, Hans	Crucifixion	Linden panel	In this impressive panel by Baldung even the wood of the crosses seems cruelly alive. The bad Thief's body is still tied to his tree, one tormented foot visible just above the Magdalen's head.
./images/2790.jpg	BALDUNG GRIEN, Hans	Coronation of the Virgin	Panel	Baldung's larger religious works, such as the Coronation of the Virgin, have received criticism for their heavy-handed portrayal of holy personages and the pronounced effects they display. His smaller devotional panels were more successful.
./images/2792.jpg	BALDUNG GRIEN, Hans	Mater Dolorosa	Wood	Hans Baldung Grien represents an interesting and individual trend in the history of German painting in the sixteenth century. Although he began his career as a painter in Nuremberg very much under the influence of DÃ¼rer, during his activity in Strasbourg and Freiburg he developed his own ideas and revealed in his altar-pieces, historical compositions and portraits, as well as his prolific output of graphic work, an exceedingly rich imagination and a growing predilection for characterization.Vigorous lines, clear and plastic forms and bold presentation are the characteristic features of his picture in Budapest, the Mater Dolorosa. Originally the panel was on the outer side of an altarwing. Its companion-piece was a Vir Dolorum (Man of Sorrows).
./images/2795.jpg	BALDUNG GRIEN, Hans	The Lamentation of Christ	Lime panel	Kneeling beneath the crosses of Calvary, the Virgin mourns her Son whose body lies before her. John supports the dead Christ's head, while Mary Magdalene, her long hair flowing, lifts one of His hands to her cheek. Behind John stands Joseph of Arimathaea with an anointing-vessel, and behind the Virgin rises the upright of the bare cross, stained with the blood of the crucified Saviour; on the tree next to it can be seen the bound foot of one of the thieves. Beyond is a rocky landscape with a castle on the edge of a lake.Apart from the Berlin panel, the theme of the Lamentation occurs in only one other painting by Baldung. The picture in the Landesmuseum at Innsbruck, which bears the date 1513 and is clearly an earlier work, is much more constricted, more angular and restless in its composition. In the Berlin painting the dramatic outburst of grief on the part of John and Mary Magdalene has given way to silent resignation. This simplification of the forms and softening of the outline is also apparent in two drawings on the same theme, a sketch in Basel for the Innsbruck painting, which bears the date 1513, and a drawing in a private collection, which is dated 1515. By studying as well two woodcuts on the same subject, the consistent development of Baldung's style from early apprenticeship to the full maturity of the Berlin Lamentation shows up in a telling manner.The artist, whose family came from Swabia, was born at Weyersheim near Strasbourg. At the age of 18 he began his apprenticeship in DÃ¼rer's workshop in Nuremberg. It may have been the patricians of the imperial city who later obtained for him the commission for two altarpieces which he completed around 1507 for Halle Cathedral. One, representing the Adoration of the Magi, eventually found its way to the Berlin Gallery. While in Strasbourg, of which town he had become a burgher in 1509, he received the important commission for the high altar in Freiburg Cathedral, whereupon he moved to Freiburg and spent several years there, roughly between 1512 and 1517. It was only towards the end of the second decade, when he had completed this major work, that Baldung seems to have painted the Lamentation, in which one can detect traces of the imposing Freiburg style, a distinct departure from the late-Gothic resonances of the Innsbruck panel.Hardly anything is known about the origins of this picture. At one time it belonged to a private collector in southern France. Wilhelm Bode bought it and presented it to the Berlin Gallery in 1907.
./images/2796.jpg	BALDUNG GRIEN, Hans	The Lamentation of Christ (detail)	Lime panel	The composition is dominated by the body of Christ, covered in wounds, who lies on a shroud at the foot of the cross. Behind him sits the grieving Mother of God. Mary Magdalene has, in a gentle gesture, taken hold of the left hand of Christ and brought it to her face. The background shows a peaceful landscape with a castle towering above a steep precipice at the bottom of which is a lake.
./images/2797.jpg	BALDUNG GRIEN, Hans	Nativity	Oil on wood	An idyllic representation of the frequently painted subject from one of the most peculiar German Renaissance artists.By electing to portray the main figures simply and quietly at the back of the stable, Baldung draws the eye first to the ruined architecture and the ox and ass seen in larger scale on the left. His construction of the interior embraces the opposite poles of precise foreshortening - as in the incisively drawn plynth in the foreground - and perspective uncertainty, something heightened by the differences in scale between animals and the figures. Viewer irritation and Mannerist alienation are quite clearly not the artist's aims, however.With the help of painted light, whose source seems to lie beyond the natural world, Baldung portrays the miracle of the Holy Night with what is for him an unusual depth of feeling. The infant Jesus, held in his swaddling bands by putti, seems to radiate light onto Joseph's red coat and Mary's hands and face. Through the brick archway in the cracked, plastered wall, we glimpse a second miraculous vision: an angel encircled by a radiant glory is appearing to a shepherd watching his flock. The fusion of light and shade and the soft modulation of the contours suggest that Baldung may have come into contact with the Danube School.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 2 minutes):Michael Praetorius: Motet
./images/2798.jpg	BALDUNG GRIEN, Hans	Mucius Scaevola	Lime wood	Mucius Scaevola (Livy 2:12-13) was a hero of Roman legend. When the Etruscan forces, led by Lars Porsena, king of Clusium, were besieging Rome, a young Roman nobleman, Caius Mucius, succeeded in penetrating the enemy lines in disguise, meaning to kill Porsena. By mistake he killed the king's secretary who was sitting beside him. Mucius was seized but, to show how cheaply he held his life, thrust his right hand into the flames of an altar fire and let it burn. Porsena, amazed by his endurance, set him free. He was thereafter called Scaevola, meaning 'left-handed'.In painting, of the Renaissance and later, Mucius stands for the virtues of patience and constancy. His sacrifice was also held to be a prefiguration of Christ's sacrifice.
./images/2800.jpg	BALDUNG GRIEN, Hans	Portrait of a Young Man with a Rosary	Oil on panel	The artist is one of the most original and creative figures of the German Renaissance. Born in the village of SchwÃ¤bisch-Gmund in south-west Germany, his family established close connections with Strasbourg. It was here that Baldung worked for most of his life, apart from four years in Nuremberg spent in DÃ¼rer's workshop (1503-c. 1507) and five years in Freiburg-im-Bresgau (1512-17) where he painted his masterpiece, The Coronation of the Virgin, for the high altar of the MÃ¼nster. Baldung was a prolific artist and his oeuvre comprises numerous prints and designs for book illustrations and stained-glass, as well as paintings and drawings. He was the most individual of DÃ¼rer's assistants and his style and treatment of colour are remarkably expressive. The range of subject matter in Baldung's work matches his technical dexterity: religious and mythological themes, in addition to a fascination for witches, are vividly, almost shockingly, handled. In achieving this emphatic style, Baldung was influenced by GrÃ¼newald, Cranach, and artists of the Danube school. It is clear that he was inspired by the spirit of the Reformation and this encouraged an element of dualism in his work, most evident during the 1520s. Strasbourg was sympathetic to Reformist ideas and the artist himself was buried in the Protestant cemetery.Portrait of a Young Man with a Rosary is an early work; it is, in fact, the first dated portrait in Baldung's oeuvre, painted on his return to Strasbourg two years after The Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian (Nuremburg, GermÃ¤nisches Nationalmuseum). The style, combining linearity with a perfectly controlled understanding of the liquidity of paint, is clearly dependent upon DÃ¼rer, especially his portraits including that of Burkhard von Speyer in the Royal Collection, painted while DÃ¼rer was in Venice from 1506 to 1507. However, the liveliness of the almost quixotic characterisation is typical of Baldung. At the upper edge in the centre, as part of the signature, is an image of an owl attacking a bird on a branch, which perhaps symbolises the conflict between good and evil or day and night. This piece of symbolism should perhaps be seen in the context of the rosary held by the sitter.The painting was part of the collection of Italian, German and early Netherlandish pictures formed by Prince Ludwig Kraft Ernst von Oettingen Wallerstein (1791-1870), which Prince Albert accepted as surety for a financial loan in 1847. The collection was put on display in Kensington Palace in 1848 in order to encourage a buyer, but this ploy failed and so the pictures came into the possession of Prince Albert. In 1863 Queen Victoria presented twenty-five of the best paintings to the National Gallery, London, in memory of the Prince Consort and in accordance with his wishes. Like several other paintings in the Oettingen Wallerstein collection, Portrait of a Young Man with a Rosary previously belonged to Count Joseph von Rechberg (1769-1833).
./images/2801.jpg	BALDUNG GRIEN, Hans	Ludwig, Count von LÃÂ¶wenstein	Linden panel	Baldung's portraits have an eccentric, loopy authority as seen in the portrait of Ludwig, Count von LÃ¶wenstein (1463-1524), which may have faced a lost pendant showing his wife. Later legitimised, Ludwig was the bastard warrior son of Duke Frederick I the Victorious and an Augsburg resident, Clara Tott. At the time of his murder in 1524, he had received titles from and was active as military councilor to Maximilian I.
./images/2817.jpg	BALEN, Hendrick van	Allegory of Abundance	Oil on panel	This panel is the result of the collaboration between Jan Brueghel the Elder and Hendrick van Balen. It belongs to the line of Flemish painting dedicated to the allegorical portrayal of the seasons and their riches. Van Balen, a master in the portrayal of divinities, depicts them here in all their splendour. The luxuriant, verdant background was painted by Brueghel.
./images/2818.jpg	BALEN, Hendrick van	Minerva and the Nine Muses	Oil on panel	Ovid describes (Met. 5:250-268) how Minerva visited the Muses on Mt helicon, their home, to listen to their song and story and to see the sacred spring, the Hippocrene, which flowed from a rock after it had been struck by the hoof of the winged horse, Pegasus. The scene is a wooded mountain-side  where the company of Muses are playing their instruments. Minerva is just arriving. Pegasus is seen in the background leaping from a high rock from which water gushes. The association of Minerva and the Muses was in line with the tradition that made her patroness of the arts.
./images/2819.jpg	BALEN, Hendrick van	Diana Turns Actaeon into a Stag	Oil on copper	The story with Diana and Actaeon was a favourite with the late Mannerist painters. This is understandable, because the myth, particularly in Ovid's playful, witty and lively presentation, contains both stimulatingly erotic and shivering horror story elements and thus was perfectly suited for the contemporary spirit. In Balen's painting Diana's figure is placed in the centre in a regal position. Over the head of the virgin goddess, Cupid is holding a crown of flowers. The action is developed in depth and the light falling on the women bathing in the clearing in the background indicates that the scene is located in a shadowy wood. The artist painted his figures according to Italian models.
./images/2820.jpg	BALEN, Hendrick van	Diana Resting after the Hunt	Oil on oak	Together with three nymphs, Diana, the Greek goddess of the hunt and of wild untamed nature has retired to a small island in the stream and attends to her toilet after the exertions of the hunt. Hendrick van Balen set this idyllic group of figures in a lush woodland landscape by Jan Brueghel the Elder. In addition to the landscape and the staffage figures, there is a further thematic group: the still-life in the foreground depicting the game which the hunters have just killed. This is thought to have been painted by Frans Snyders, who worked in van Balen's studio and is considered a specialist in the painting of dead animals.
./images/2821.jpg	BALEN, Hendrick van	Feast of the Gods	Oil on copper	This small painting was created by a collaboration between Hendrick van Balen and Jan Brueghel the Elder. The former painted the figures, the latter the landscape and the still-life elements. The painting may represent the wedding banquet of Peleus and Thetis, the parents of the Greek hero Achilles, which was attended by the gods of Olympus.Van Balen painted this subject on a number of occasions, some in collaboration with Jan Brueghel the Elder.
./images/2822.jpg	BALEN, Hendrick van	Herse and her Sisters with Mercury	Oil on panel	Ovid (Met. 2:708-832) tells how three sisters, returning from the festival of Minerva and carrying her sacred baskets on their heads, were espied by Mercury who immediately fell in love with the most beautiful of them, Herse. Another of the sisters, Aglauros, was consumed with envy, and tried to prevent Mercury entering Herse's chamber when he came to her one night. He touched Aglauros with his wand and she turned to black stone, the colour of her thoughts.The present playful and sensuous representation of the story is similar both in style and theme to a number of others executed by van Balen and his circle. Van Balen was specialised in small cabinet pictures which often depicted mythological scenes.
./images/2823.jpg	BALEN, Hendrick van	The Judgment of Paris	Oil on canvas	The Judgment of Paris (the son of a Trojan king, Priam) is the most popular of all mythological themes in art. The scene depicts the story of his award of the golden apple to Venus in a contest of beauty between her, Juno, and Minerva.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 3 minutes):Cristoph Willibald Gluck: Paride ed Elena, Paris' aria
./images/2824.jpg	BALEN, Hendrick van	Odysseus as a Guest of the Nymph Calypso	Oil on wood	In this mythological scene the arrangement of beast and bird depicts the Four Elements, according to the tradition of Flemish cabinet painting. The painting is a result of collaboration of three painters: Hendrick van Balen painted the figures, all the animals were painted by Jan Brueghel the Elder, and Joos de Momper produced the wild and rugged  mountain landscape.
./images/2825.jpg	BALEN, Hendrick van	Holy Trinity	Oil on panel	Hendrick van Balen - particularly after about 1615 - had some significance as a painter of altarpieces of a monumental size. In these works the preference for colourful detail so characteristic of the cabinet painter is conspicuous. In the Holy Trinity the characters look monumental, unmistakably influenced by Rubens's style.
./images/2826.jpg	BALEN, Hendrick van	Virgin and Child with the Infant St John, Surrounded by Animals	Oil on oak panel	This panel is the result of a collaboration between Hendrick van Balen and Jan Brueghel the Younger. Like in other collaborative works, the figures were painted by van Balen.
./images/2827.jpg	BALEN, Hendrick van	Wings of an Altarpiece	Oil on panel	Hendrik van Balen was an Antwerp artist and the teacher of Anthony van Dyck. He mainly painted religious and mythological scenes. He specialized in human figures and was often asked to add staffage to landscapes painted by his colleagues.The two panels, Virgin and Child with Angels and John the Baptist rebuking King Herod, served originally as the shutters of a triptych. The centre panel, St John Preaching to the Multitude, is no longer in the cathedral.The left wing shows angels preparing Jesus' bath. One of them is about to take the Infant from his mother's arms, while another carries a basin and a third angel a pair of towels. Other little angels look down from a cloudy sky. The charming scene prefigures the Baptism of Christ by John the Baptist. By using such a familiar scene from everyday life, the artist was able to intensify the spiritual appeal to the ordinary viewer.The scene in the right wing is much more dramatic. Inside a classical palace, John the Baptist rebukes Herod Antipas, the King of Palestine, for his adulterous marriage to Herodias, who witnesses the confrontation with a lady-in-waiting. The preacher duly paid for his accusations with his life.
./images/2828.jpg	BALESTRA, Antonio	View of the main hall	Fresco	TheVilla Pompei Carlottiin Illasi (Verona) was rebuilt between 1731 and 1737 according to the design of the owner, Alessandro Pompei, a patrician from Verona and a remarkable intellectual, architect, and virtuoso painter. In 1738, after the reconstruction was completed, the brothers Alberto and Alessandro Pompei asked Antonio Balestra, a renowned Veronese painter and Alessandro's former teacher, to create frescoes for the vast main hall. The other spaces in the villa were decorated by Balestra's disciples.The main hall, a luminous, double-height space that occupies the central portion of the building, is completely covered in faux architectural decoration. The lower portion of the wall surface is measured off by pairs of fluted columns of a composite order, which rest on a tall marmorino skirting board that circles the entire perimeter. The space between each pair of columns contains a depiction of a god, painted to imitate a marble statue. There are twelve in all. On the short walls, faux frames contain The Killing of Achilles and The Abduction of Helen. Above the doors, four ovals enclose monochrome mythological scenes. On the upper portion of the wall, twelve figures of cupids appear between pairs of pilasters.The vault of the ceiling is covered by The Triumph of Love, illusionistically supported by large, bulging corbels, set within an elaborate trompe l'oeil layout.
./images/2829.jpg	BALESTRA, Antonio	The Killing of Achilles	Fresco	On the short walls of the main hall, faux frames contain The Killing of Achilles and The Abduction of Helen. Balestra's unusual skills as a colourist can be appreciated in these scenes.In The Killing of Achilles, the hero lies on the ground, shown in foreshortened view, killed by the arrow that has pierced his vulnerable heel. In the background, the smiling Paris stands behind a sacrificial altar, having just committed the crime, after promising his sister Polygene to the hero. Polygene, unwitting tool and witness to the ambush, is consoled by her mother, Hecuba, wife of Priam, the king of Troy.

Balestra's unusual skills as a colourist can be appreciated in these scenes.In The Abduction of Helen, the two protagonists stage a charming minuet, moving toward the boat that awaits them. They are enveloped by the soft light of the sky, traversed by puffy clouds. The stillness of the scene as a whole is enlivened by a gust of wind that reveals the softness of the drapery.

./images/2833.jpg	BALESTRA, Antonio	View of the ceiling	Fresco	The the ceiling in the main hall of the villa, unfortunately damaged and repainted in certain areas, has a representation of The Triumph of Love, after Francesco Petrarch's poem. Cupid's ardent chariot burst through the clouds, drawn by majestic, impetuous steeds, headed toward Venus's beloved island of Cythera, where Cupid, the small but powerful god, will celebrate his triumph over man, who is vanquished by pleasure. On the gilded vehicle, Cupid is about to shoot his dart toward the throng he has subjugated.The composition of the ceiling fresco, particularly the superb quartet of horses, might have made an impression on Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, who would return to this scheme on numerous occasions.

./images/2835.jpg	BALESTRA, Antonio	Theseus Discovering his Father's Sword	Oil on canvas	Theseus is a legendary Greek hero, king of Athens, and a famous slayer of monsters. Though his father was the king of Athens, Theseus was born and brought up in Troezen. Here his father placed a sword and sandals under a heavy rock and left orders that his child was to follow him to Athens when he was strong enough to lift the rock and bring the tokens hidden underneath.

./images/2840.jpg	BALESTRA, Antonio	Virgin and Christ Child with Saints	Oil on canvas	The represented saints in this large altarpiece in the church of the Gesuiti are Sts Stanislaus Kostka, Luigi Gonzaga, and Francesco Borgia. Balestra's classicising art is apparent in the clearly defined physiognomies, and the composition is a lesson in the representation of unequivocal forms.
./images/2841.jpg	BALTENS, Peeter	Christ on the Road to Calvary	Oil on oak panel	Traditionally the painting was ascribed to Pieter Bruegel the Elder, however, now Baltens' authorship is fully recognised. The composition was probably inspired, but only in the broadest of outlines, by PieterBruegel's paintingof this subject, dated 1564, now in Vienna, Kunsthistorisches Museum, which Baltens must have known in Antwerp.
./images/2842.jpg	BALTENS, Peeter	The Feast of St George with Theatre and Procession	Oil on panel	In Flanders, village feasts took place to celebrate Saints Days to whom churches and the country's town and village guilds were dedicated. These feasts were always accompanied by religious processions but also by theatrical shows, games and archery competitions.Here, the village square, which lies at the heart of the feast, is seen from above. This procedure allowed Peeter Baltens to linger over a myriad of episodes. Grouped together in this way, they constitute a summary of the celebrations and allow more than a hundred characters to be presented in the same painting. The dominant red of the clothes, typical in Baltens's works, adds to the rhythm of the whole, reinforcing the effect of joyous excitement that emanates from the paintings of the master.
./images/2854.jpg	BAMBINI, NicolÃÂ²	View of the main hall	Fresco	The palace, now owned by the UniversitÃ  Ca' Foscari, was acquired by the old, noble Venetian Dolfin family in 1621. After a succession of projects to expand and modernize it, in 1710 the building finally achieved magnificence through a new restoration, designed by Domenico Rossi. The commissioner of the renovation was Daniele III Dolfin. The decoration of the main hall (salone) was executed by NicolÃ² Bambini with the collaboration of the quadratura painter Antonio Felice Ferrari.The decoration contains an elaborate, multiform iconographic program on the vault. It celebrates the virtues of the Dolfin family that distinguished itself at the end of the seventeenth century, in politics, military and the world of letters.
./images/2855.jpg	BAMBINI, NicolÃÂ²	View of the ceiling	Fresco	This fresco on the ceiling of the salone in Ca' Dolfin was executed by Bambini with the collaboration of the quadratura painter Antonio Felice Ferrari. A false loggia in rose marble augments the height of the room, opening it onto an expanse of sky. Arrayed among the clouds is an allegory of Venice between personifications of Virtues and the gods of Olympus, including Amphitrite riding a gigantic dolphin, an allusion to the Dolfin family.This fresco is the most Baroque creation in the field of monumental decoration in early eighteenth-century Venice.

./images/2863.jpg	BAMBINI, NicolÃÂ²	Triumph of Venice	Oil on canvas	"Bambini, a favourite with the Venetian aristocracy, executed this commission for the Pesaro family, glorifying both the Republic and the family through clear visual allusions to the 16th-century paintings in the Palazzo Ducale. The theme is spelled out in the Latin inscription near the bottom of the composition: ""ferro aeque sceptroque potens"" (powerful equally through sword and sceptre).On the initiative of Leonardo Pesaro, the image of Venus triumphant made its appearance in a private residence for the first time, emerging from the official context of the Palazzo Ducale."

./images/2887.jpg	BANTI, Cristiano	Three Peasant Women	Oil on canvas	Along with Telemaco Signorini, Silvestro Lega, and Giovanni Fattori, Cristiano Banti was one of the leading members of the 'Macchiaioli' group who frequented the CaffÃ¨ Michelangiolo in Florence, meeting-place of progressive artists. Banti later became a teacher at the Florentine Academy.In the Three Peasant Women, the figures are rendered in a rather abstract but luminous outdoor setting with the intimate, dreamlike character of almost Symbolist qualities.
./images/2888.jpg	BANTI, Cristiano	Woman Sewing on the Terrace	Oil on canvas	In this scene of tranquil domesticity, the artist has chosen an unusual vantage point from a position far below the subject. This approach may have been influenced by the compositions of Japanese prints, which were so popular this time.

A Romantic icon and one of the first proponents of the orchestral tone poem, he was an unparalleled keyboard virtuoso and a supremely talented and innovative composer. He was also renowned as a mercurial personality and bandit of love; in short, like the flamboyant violinist NiccolÃ² Paganini, Liszt lived the Romantic ideal to the hilt.Listen to anexampleof Liszt's piano music.

'Allow me to take the liberty of sending you, dear lady, a pair of doves as a present  ... When watching them play, think of your faithful admirer."" This is what the Home Secretary of Pest-Buda in the year 1832 suggested to the gentlemen.The picture shows the home of a daughter of a good family. Her charming face and carriage are typical of the ideals of the last century: she is the symbol of innocence and protection. The pigeon makes the impression of innocence stronger and lets us know that secret emotions will soon wing away out of  the cage of the bierdermeier room: a wing of the pigeon indicates that the bird is ready to fly.The picture is a fascinating one and the way it is  painted indicates virtuosity. Whites are rivalling one another in making the portrayal lifelike: the taffeta-like stiff silk dress is glistening as if metal, the soft grey of the feathers makes the white of the wing softer, but it is highlighted by the colour of  the arms and the shoulders. The white of the window-post is radiating hard,  to which  the  soft brown of  the sunshone table and the fresh red of the rose answer. This picture is a portrait, but it is a perfect genre picture of the age, too ..."

He won the great support of the literary and political leaders of the Reform Age, and was undeniably a pioneer of Hungarian national art. He was a founder and active member of art life in Hungary, and the beginings of Hungarian genre painting are also linked with his name.He painted The Rumanian peasant family, dressed in folk costume, with great care and fine observation, setting them in the magnificent landscape of his native Transylvania. With justification this picture was considered the most beautiful folk genre painting of its time. It met with great success at the 1844 exhibition of the Vienna Art Association, and later in Pest. In 1846, the Pest journal ""HonderÃ»"" reported with great enthusiasm that the picture had been bought by the Hungarian Civilian Guard of Pest for the National Joseph Picture Gallery. The donation can still be seen on the inscription on the frame."

./images/2902.jpg	BARBARI, Jacopo de'	Portrait of a Man	Oil on linden panel	This painting dates to about 1505-06, when Jacopo was working in Wittenberg for the dukes of Saxony. The portrait reflects the strong influence of DÃ¼rer, but its monochrome colour scheme - dark gray cap and coat against a dark background - is unlike anything in Italy or Germany at the beginning of the sixteenth century.
./images/2903.jpg	BARBARI, Jacopo de'	Portrait of a Man	Oil on poplar panel	This portrait shows a combination of stylistic features relating to both Venetian and German traditions. Accordingly, it was first attributed to northern Italian painters, more specifically to Bartolomeo Veneto, then German artists, specifically to Bernhard Strigel. More recently, the attribution to Jacopo de' Barbari has gained general acceptance.The Venetian Jacopo de' Barbari worked at various princely courts north of the Alps between 1500 and his death. It is known that while he was still in Venice he was already interested in northern European culture. The present painting may date a time when he was working on his famous woodcut view of Venice.The sitter of the portrait has not been identified. The man with the blond hair and northern attire could be a well-to-do German, probably a merchant, one of the German residents in Venice. The beret and the heavy , fur-lined overcoat are similar to those inDÃ¼rer's portrait of Hans Tucher.The reverse side of the panel is painted by the same artist, it represents an allegory.
./images/2904.jpg	BARBARI, Jacopo de'	Allegory (verso of the Portrait of a Man)	Oil on poplar panel	The reverse side of the Portrait of a Man is painted by the same artist, it represents an allegory. Two figures stand in the centre of an unfurnished interior, nude except for wispy, transparent veils. Traditionally, they are interpreted as lovers. The painting combines an allegorical scene containing vanitas features with an exquisite still-life in the foreground, an allusion to the creative power of painting.The erotic connotation evokes depictions of Adam and Eve at the moment of the Fall as well as the theme ofDeath and Maiden,which became better known in the 1520s through Hans Baldung Grien.
./images/2906.jpg	BARBARI, Jacopo de'	Portrait of Fra Luca Pacioli and an Unknown Young Man	Wood	Fra Luca Bartolomeo de Pacioli (sometimes Paciolo) (1446/7-1517) was an Italian mathematician and Franciscan friar, collaborator with Leonardo da Vinci, and seminal contributor to the field now known as accounting. He was also called Luca di Borgo after his birthplace, Borgo Santo Sepolcro, Tuscany.The table is filled with geometrical tools: slate, chalk, compass, a dodecahedron model and a rhombicuboctahedron half-filed with water is hanging in the air. Pacioli is demonstrating a theorem by Euclid.
./images/2911.jpg	BARBARI, Jacopo de'	Still-Life with Partridge and Gauntlet	Wood	Barbari was the first Italian Renaissance artist of note to travel to the German and Netherlandish courts. He probably received training with Alvise Vivarini in Venice in the 1490s. His best-known painting is the Still Life with a Dead Partridge of 1504, a trompe l'oeil probably made for one of the palaces of the Saxon dukes.This Still-Life with Partridge, Gauntlet and Bolt of a Crossbow is the earliest independent still-life in the European painting. It is one of those paintings that mislead the unprepared viewer by displaying the wall on which these objects have been hung. It is likely that the painting was cleverly integrated into the room of a hunting lodge where it was intended to provide amusement to the hunting party. Nowadays we would hardly be deceived by such a painting technique. At the time, however, it was radically new and people's habits of perception had been formed by less illusionist paintings. Barbari's still-life is akin to extremely precise studies of nature by contemporary German artists such as DÃ¼rer and Lucas Cranach the Elder. It has therefore been suggested that the Italian artist was influenced by DÃ¼rer.
./images/2914.jpg	BARBAULT, Jean	Young Woman Dressed in Neapolitan Fashion	Oil on canvas	Many of Barbault's paintings are depictions of single figures set in a dark or neutral background. His two most famous series were a suite of figures in Oriental costume and one of figures in contemporary Italian dress. The present painting is an example from the latter group.

./images/2919.jpg	BARBIERI, Paolo Antonio	The Spice Shop	Oil on canvas	Paolo Antonio Barbieri, brother of the famous Guercino, was a master of the still-life. The austere composition of The Spice Shop, in which tall spice jars are arranged in a row parallel to the picture plane, has similarities with the art of Jacopo da Empoli, while the characterization of the youthful and romantic seller of spices reflects aspects of Guercinoâs style, though the execution is drier.
./images/2920.jpg	BARBIERI, Paolo Antonio	Still-Life	Oil on canvas	The present still-life depicts pears, peaches, figs, a melon, cabbage and marrow. It has a pendant (private collection), a still-life depicting various fruits.Barbieri's conservative and refined approach to still-life painting is evident in these still-lifes. Each grouping of fruit or vegetables is thoughtfully and delicately placed, yet each object and placement seems premeditated and assertive within the composition. This meditation on space is a ubiquitous theme in Barbieri's oeuvre.

./images/2924.jpg	BARENDSZ., Dirck	The Last Judgment	Oil on plaster	This depiction of the subject derives from Tintoretto's Last Judgment (Madonna dell'Orto, Venice) in both its general composition and individual motifs. Like several other Netherlandish painters, Dirck Barendsz. may have worked in Tintoretto's studio for a while. There, or in its owner's house, he would also have seen Tintoretto's Susanna and the Elders (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna), of which he makes use for the female sinner shown being resurrected in the lower part of his composition.

./images/2930.jpg	BARNA DA SIENA	The Mystical Marriage of Saint Catherine	Tempera on panel	This is the most beautiful and mysterious of the paintings attributed to Barna da Siena. The design of the painting operates four shifts of scale: from the grand, still figures of Catherine and Christ, to the charming miniaturized scene of the Christ Child standing on the bench between mother and grandmother, to the angels battling with black devils below them, and, tiniest of all, to the embracing warriors who have cast away their swords - probably the joint patrons, whose angelic reconciliation this haunting work commemorates.
./images/2931.jpg	BARNA DA SIENA	Scenes from the New Testament	Fresco	Following Vasari, the frescoes in the north aisle of the collegiate church in San Gimignano were long attributed to a painter by the name of Barna da Siena. Vasari based this attribution on Ghiberti, who in the Commentarii (written about 1447) adopted a tradition that was obviously incorrect. Now there is a broad agreement among scholars that Vasari's information on the figure and life of Barna was freely invented. It is generally assumed today that the painter of the frescoes was from the immediate circle of Simone Martini, most probably Lippo Memmi.You can find a description of the frescoes in the north aislein the section of Lippo Memmi.
./images/2932.jpg	BARNABA DA MODENA	Crucifixion	Tempera and gold on wood	A characteristic feature of this panel is the contrast between the upper celestial Christian realm and the earthbound dominion of pagan Rome, represented in the lower part.
./images/2933.jpg	BARNABA DA MODENA	Pentecost	Egg tempera on wood	This panel is a fragment of an altarpiece. An Ascension (Pinacoteca Capitolina, Rome) and a Nativity (Pinacoteca di Brera, Milan) could have formed part of the same composite work.
./images/2934.jpg	BARNABA DA MODENA	Ascension	Egg tempera on wood	This panel is a fragment of an altarpiece. The Pentecost (National Gallery, London) and a Nativity (Pinacoteca di Brera, Milan) could have formed part of the same composite work.
./images/2935.jpg	BARNABA DA MODENA	The Nativity with the Virgin adoring the Child	Egg tempera on wood	This panel is a fragment of an altarpiece. The Pentecost (National Gallery, London) and an Ascension (Pinacoteca Capitolina, Rome) could have formed part of the same composite work.
./images/2936.jpg	BARNABA DA MODENA	Altarpiece	Egg tempera on wood	This panel probably belonged a larger ensemble. It consists of four scenes and a predella. The scenes, arranged thematically in vertical pairs, depict The Coronation of the Virgin, The Trinity, The Virgin and Child with Donors, and The Crucifixion. The predella, divided into two parts, shows the twelve Apostles, not individually distinguished.
./images/2937.jpg	BARNABA DA MODENA	Altarpiece (detail)	Egg tempera on wood	The detail shows the donors before the Virgin and Child, probably Juana Manuel, Queen of Castile (c. 1335-1381), and her father or husband, presented by St Raphael.
./images/2938.jpg	BARNABA DA MODENA	Altarpiece (detail)	Egg tempera on wood	The detail shows the angels playing a fiddle, a lute, a portative organ and nakers in the Coronation of the Virgin.
./images/2939.jpg	BARNABA DA MODENA	Virgin and Child	Tempera on panel	The surviving framing edges indicate that this panel was initially the central section of a polyptych.
./images/2941.jpg	BAROCCI, Federico Fiori	Aeneas' Flight from Troy	Oil on canvas	Federico Barrocci's Aeneas' Flight from Troy with Anchises, his son Ascanius and his wife Creusa is the second version painted in 1598 of a picture executed ten years earlier for Emperor Rudolf II of Austria. Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere presented Cardinal Scipione with this second version, which entered the Borghese collection before 1613. It was this painting that inspired Cardinal Scipione to commission a large marble group on the same subject from Gian Lorenzo Bernini (also in the Borghese Gallery). The myth of Aeneas, ancestor of Romulus and Remus, referred to the birth of Rome and thus confirmed the Borghese family's high status in the city.Barrocci's many drawings of nature led him to achieve a spontaneity and naturalness in movement, colour and airy effects, and a silvery luminosity that was to influence the 17th-century masters, particularly Rubens. Never before had flames been painted so close to, with an energy suggesting even the crackle of the fire, from which Ascanius seems to be protecting himself by covering his ears. But the human delicacy of Barrocci's anti-heroic and anti-rhetorical figures was not to be really appreciated in Rome, because it could not compete with the classical antique statuary.
./images/2943.jpg	BAROCCI, Federico Fiori	Annunciation	Oil on canvas	Barocci's altarpieces reveal his precise and rapid response to the instructions issued by the Council of Trent on religious art. The Mannerists may have had a refined intellectual quality but they were too often abstruse. Mannerism was now definitely swept aside. In its place came simple images with an obvious flow of them, free of mysteries or complications. Sacred episodes were set in the context of everyday reality. This can be seen from the way Barocci includes the Ducal Palace at Urbino in the background of this altarpiece in the Coli-Pontani Chapel of S. Maria degli Angeli in Perugia, and fills the picture with descriptive detail, including the sleeping cat in the foreground. The figures' sweetness of expression is a direct reference to Correggio.
./images/2944.jpg	BAROCCI, Federico Fiori	Annunciation	Oil on canvas	Barocci painted this Annunciation for the chapel of his patron, Francesco Maria II della Rovere, duke of Urbino, in the Basilica of Loreto between the years 1582 and 1584. In 1797 the altarpiece was seized by French troops and transferred to Paris, where it remained until 1815. Probably because of damage caused on its journey to Paris, the panel was first placed on a cloth base, but since this proved too light in weight, it became necessary to transfer it onto a stronger canvas.Many copies of the painting are known to exist, they were produced by re-utilization of the same preparatory drawing, either by Barocci himself or by his workshop.
./images/2945.jpg	BAROCCI, Federico Fiori	The Circumcision	Oil on canvas	This altarpiece was executed following a series of preliminary drawings for the church of the Brotherhood of the Name of Jesus at Pesaro.
./images/2947.jpg	BAROCCI, Federico Fiori	Rest on the Flight to Egypt	Oil on canvas	Even in his smaller canvasses which were painted for private chapels or collectors, Barocci abandoned the often cold calligraphy of the Mannerists. Instead, he favoured delicate images, rosy colours, soft light, and landscape settings. This did not mean that Barocci was not also a refined painter. Indeed, in a painting like this the way that the gestures and looks of the characters link to each other shows that he studied his compositions carefully. But what he did not do was to show off cleverness for its own sake. The way that he accurately describes a number of details (the fruits, the metal objects, or the items in the bottom left corner) foreshadows the imminent developments that would give rise to the new (for Italy) genre of still-lifes. This is yet another confirmation of Barocci's key role in a time of transition.
./images/2948.jpg	BAROCCI, Federico Fiori	The Institution of the Eucharist	Oil on canvas	This painting was commissioned by Clement VIII in 1603 but was finished only three years after his death in 1605. Clement exercised a great deal of control over the artist in order to be certain that he depicted the subject exactly to his wishes.
./images/2950.jpg	BAROCCI, Federico Fiori	La Madonna del Gatto	Oil on canvas	This painting represents the Virgin and Child with Saint Joseph and the Infant Baptist. The title refers to the cat (gatto) seen at lower left.
./images/2952.jpg	BAROCCI, Federico Fiori	The Nativity	Oil on canvas	Aspects of what was to be known as the Baroque style can be seen in Barocci's Nativity.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 4 minutes):Giuseppe Aldrovandini: Sonata in D Major for two trumpets, strings and basso continuo
./images/2953.jpg	BAROCCI, Federico Fiori	Madonna del Popolo	Oil on panel	Barocci was profoundly influenced by the works of Correggio, as seen in his celebrated Madonna del Popolo. Barocci emphasizes the dramatic instant of the Virgin's intercession for her people before a loving Christ..The scene is caught up in a bewitching fusion of everyday experience with otherworldly rapture.
./images/2954.jpg	BAROCCI, Federico Fiori	Portrait of a Gentleman	Oil on canvas	The painting represents a portrait of an unidentified gentleman, bust length, wearing a black jerkin and white ruff. The physiognomy is well understood and the gradation of colour, shifting gently in pastel-like tones, is entirely typical of the artist.
./images/2955.jpg	BAROCCI, Federico Fiori	Portrait of a Young Woman	Oil on paper	Her heart-shaped face accentuated by her coiffure, this young woman's expression is more intriguing than her peaches-and-cream complexion might imply. Her coloration is typical of Barocci in these years, to the point that she strongly resembles both a soldier and an angel in other works.
./images/2956.jpg	BAROCCI, Federico Fiori	Double Portrait with the Della Rovere Family Emblem	Oil on canvas	This double portrait depicts a nobleman proffering an oak branch full of acorns to a young woman. The bearded male figure, dressed in a severe black costume, stands behind the woman pointing to the oak branch. The picture's format suggests the celebration of a conjugal relationship. The oak and acorns, an emblem long associated with the Della Rovere family of Urbino, indicate that at least one of the two sitters was a member of that family. However, the sitters and the event being commemorated have proven to be difficult to identify.
./images/2957.jpg	BAROCCI, Federico Fiori	Self-Portrait	Oil on canvas	The poignant naturalism of the aging painter's rheumy eyes calls attention to his skill, and also to the heightened emotion of the Baroque age, which Barocci fostered in his altarpieces and other religious subjects.
./images/2958.jpg	BAROCCI, Federico Fiori	Self-Portrait	Oil on canvas	The way Barocci composed his flesh tints can be perceived as his individual hand. As a rule, he based them on a preparatory modelling of grey hues. In his self-portrait, he combined the grey and bluish-grey half-tones with single accents of vivid vermilion. His rendering of flesh tints distinguishes him from practically all his Italian contemporaries, and particularly influenced Rubens.The present work is probably a replica of the self-portrait at the Uffizi, Florence.
./images/2959.jpg	BAROCCI, Federico Fiori	St Jerome	Oil on canvas	In this painting, recent restoration has revealed a lion, sleeping like a large cat in the background; it had been hidden under thick layers of paint that had darkened with age.
./images/2960.jpg	BAROCCI, Federico Fiori	Virgin and Child with Sts Simon and Jude (Madonna di San Simone)	Oil on canvas	This altarpiece was executed for the church of San Francesco in Urbino. In a humble interior set before a rural landscape wrapped in mist, the celestial apparition is imbued with the tender and intimate mood so typical of Barocci. The divine figures painted in bright colours shine out from the grey of the background as does the vermilion drapery. In the lower right corner the two donors of the altarpiece are depicted.
./images/2974.jpg	BARONZIO, Giovanni	Scenes from the Life of St Colomba: St Colomba Saved by a Bear	Tempera on wood	Formerly this panel, together with two other panels, all representing stories from the life of St Colomba, was attributed to an anonymous painter called the Master of St Colomba.
./images/2976.jpg	BARONZIO, Giovanni	Scenes from the Life of St Colomba: Beheading of St Colomba	Tempera on wood	Formerly this panel, together with two other panels, all representing stories from the life of St Colomba, was attributed to an anonymous painter called the Master of St Colomba.
./images/2977.jpg	BARONZIO, Giovanni	Centrepiece of a Polyptych	Tempera on panel	This panel was presumably commissioned by an associate of the Franciscan order, as suggested by the choice of Franciscan saints in the lowest section of the panel. The upper and middle sections depict the Adoration of the Magi, and the Crucifixion, respectively. The Crucifixion is clearly modelled on Giotto, and in fact the panel was once attributed to Giotto.
./images/2981.jpg	BARRA, Didier	Landscape with Buildings	Oil on canvas	"Until recent years the paintings of Didier Barra, together with those of FranÃ§ois de NomÃ©, were attributed to  a mysterious ""MonsÃ¹ Desiderio""."
./images/2984.jpg	BARRAUD, William	Portrait of Lord Methuen's Spaniels, Gipsy and Fairy	Oil on canvas	The painting is signed and dated centre right on the base of the urn: W Barraud/1846.
./images/2990.jpg	BARRERA, Francisco	The Month of May	Oil on canvas	This painting is one of a series of large-scale still-lifes of the twelve months. These comprise a wide range of foodstuffs associated with the different months arranged on a series of ledges, accompanied by a landscape vignette, complete with small figures engaged in activities appropriate for the time of year. The series is now dispersed, over half of the pictures are only known.A flower piece is the most conspicuous element in the painting of The Month of May, the season of flowers. The copious arrangement of blooms in a glass vase is placed on a red damask tablecloth, between two splendid decorative wickerwork baskets filled with fruit and vegetables. At the left of the painting, there are hunting dogs and a gun, a caged bird and various foodstuffs associated with this time of year on a shelf. The painting has a particularly cheering, sunny mood that is entirely appropriate to this season of natural regeneration.
./images/2992.jpg	BARRERA, Francisco	Still-Life	Oil on canvas	This mature work is a still-life of fish suspended from hooks, together with bowls of fish on raised ledges, with eels and other fish, eggs, cheese, an orange, ceramic pots, a pestle and mortar and a cooking pot, all arranged upon a stone top.
./images/2993.jpg	BARRERA, Francisco	Still-Life with Flowers and Fruit	Oil on canvas	Francisco Barrera became an important figure in the artistic community in Madrid during the 1630s and 1640s, when he took over leadership of the painters' guild. However, he remained a relatively undistinguished master in the panorama of painting at the Spanish court. Like many other painters of limited talents, Barrera was an all-rounder whose production centred on religious subjects, images of saints, landscapes and still-lifes. Like Juan de Arellano, Barrera worked for the open market and sold his paintings from a shop in the centre of Madrid. The rise in popularity of still-life and flower paintings among collectors in Madrid during the middle years of the century doubtlessly encouraged Barrera to turn to this genre. Although his religious paintings are unknown today, his still-life paintings show that he developed a distinct personality in paintings of this type.This painting represents lilies and carnations in an oriental-style vase, the freshness of the lilies denoted by the fact that only five of the blooms have opened. Alongside these, there is a plate of cherries and apricots, that are kept cool by pieces of snow from the wine cooler. The representation on the vase of a monkey picking fruit whimsically relates this object to the fruit collected in the bowl in the picture. A jug of water is placed in the background and in the foreground a pie rests on a napkin, with a knife.The painting typifies Barrera's style in still-life and flower painting. He has sharply defined the forms and details of the flowers, and a certain hardness in their facture reflects the influence of the flower paintings of Juan van der Hamen and Antonio Ponce, the latter working with Barrera on decorative painting projects at the Buen Retiro in the 1630s.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 2 minutes):Franz Schubert: Blumenlied (Flower Song) D 431
./images/2994.jpg	BARRET, George	Landscape with a Watermill	Oil on canvas	The painting shows a finely delineated watermill, with figures to one side and cattle to the other outside a barn; overhead the sky is overcast and brooding. The influence of Jacob van Ruisdael cam be noted, and it can be assumed that Barret had seen some of Ruisdael's watermill landscapes which served as the inspiration for this particular work.
./images/2995.jpg	BARRET, George	Landscape with an Approaching Shower	Oil on canvas	The painting depicts two figures by a stream in a landscape with an approaching shower.
./images/2996.jpg	BARRET, George	Wooded Landscape	Oil on canvas	The picture shows a woodland scene with a horseman crossing a stream.
