./images/1.jpg	AACHEN, Hans von	Oil on copper	The painting, displaying the characteristic Mannerist style of the artist, is also known as The Triumph of Justice.
./images/2.jpg	AACHEN, Hans von	Oil on canvas	The representation of this group is related to the frequently depicted sentence by Terence: Sine Cerere et Baccho friget Venus - Without Ceres (bread) and Bacchus (wine) Venus freezes. Aachen gives the mythological figures the facial features of his family: his own, his wife and their son. The motif could allude to the famous picture of the Greek painter Zeuxis. He painted a boy with grapes so naturally that the birds pecked at the painted fruits.The nude figure of a woman viewed from behind, a favourite motif in Rudolfine art, is represented here in a sensually suggestive way. The elongation of the female body is characteristic of the excessively refined Mannerist art and culture prevalent at the court in Prague c. 1600 and can also be found in the work of von Aachen's contemporaries at court, Bartholomäus Spranger and Joseph Heintz the Elder.
./images/3.jpg	AACHEN, Hans von	Copperplate	At the end of the 16th century the court of Emperor Rudolph II in Prague was one of the most important art and cultural centre of Europe. The Emperor gathered together important artists: painters, sculptors, goldsmiths, who developed a characteristic style as important as that of the Fontainebleau school flowered at the same period in France. One component of the Rudolphean style was the painting of the Flemish Spranger, another the German Hans von Aachen and the third the Swiss Joseph Heintz.Aachen studied in Italy, he spent there 14 years and was known as a portraitist. He went to Munich and worked for the Bavarian Prince. He moved to Prague in 1592 and became court painter at the court of Rudolph II.In addition to mythological subjects he painted realistic genre pictures with two-three figures.
./images/4.jpg	AACHEN, Hans von	Oil on canvas	Rudolf II (1552-1612) was the son of the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II. He became King of Hungary in 1572 and King of Bohemia in 1575. Following the death of his father he also became Holy Roman Emperor and Archduke of Austria. His reign was a troubled time of great religious conflicts coupled with the external menace of the Turks. Unfortunately, politics was not a great interest of his. Instead he was familiar with a number of languages and was devoted to art and science, the latter including alchemy and astrology, a highly fashionable preoccupation at that time. He was also fascinated by magic and the occult. At the end of the 1590s mental illness rendered him incapable of governing his empire, which by that time was torn by disputes between Reformation and Counter-Reformation movements. As a result, in 1611, he was forced to cede the crown of Bohemia to his brother Matthias and he died soon afterwards.
./images/5.jpg	AACHEN, Hans von	Oil on canvas	Hans von Aachen was an artist who fully embraced the self-portrait as a means of artistic expression. His earliest self-portrait was executed c. 1574, and he painted several other self-portraits during his career.
./images/6.jpg	AAGAARD, Carl Frederik	Oil on canvas	The painting is signed and dated 'C F Aagaard 1888' at lower left.
./images/7.jpg	AAGAARD, Carl Frederik	Oil on canvas	This painting is unusual in 19th century art in combining landscape with still-life. In the acutely observed flowers the artist has demonstrated his skills as an observer of nature, but in the more distant landscape. The two figures, possibly lovers, are framed by the forward garland but are almost incidental to the composition.
./images/8.jpg	ABADIA, Juan de la	Wood	The archangel Michael was, like St. George the dragon-killer, one of the typically warlike saints so greatly approved in the age of chivalry. The Bible tells us that he fought with Satan for the body of Moses and we can read in the Apocalypse how he defeated the dragon with seven heads and ten horns. St. Michael was therefore looked upon as one of the principal patrons of the Church who, having overcome Satan, could protect all innocent souls from the Devil.This painting illustrates the somewhat provincial style of Juan de la Abadia of Huesca. The heritage of the Trecento can be seen in the delicate, girlish countenance of the saint and the brilliant tints of the wings, but blended with it is the elegance associated with the International Gothic style. The figures are wooden and lifeless and the artist's limited knowledge of anatomy may be seen in his representation of the soul; but the carefully arranged pattern of the floor creates the illusion of space, indicating that the artist was aware of the later developments of Gothic art and was to some extent influenced by early Renaissance art.

./images/11.jpg	ABAQUESNE, MassÃ©ot	Ceramics	This tile floor originally surrounded the altar of the chapel at La Bâtie-d'Urfé. Sphinxes, burning braziers, florets, ribbons, angels and terms float freely in this design, which was inspired by ancient grotesques.

./images/13.jpg	ABBATE, NiccolÃ² dell'	-	The chimney breast was realized by the workshop of Niccolò dell' Abbate. It features figures, putti, flowers, fruit, and symbols (among them the sword symbolizing the constable's office) in trompe-l'oeil painting.
./images/14.jpg	ABBATE, NiccolÃ² dell'	Marble	The chimney breast in the large royal hall was realized by the workshop of Niccolò dell' Abbate. It features figures, putti, flowers, fruit, and symbols (among them the sword symbolizing the constable's office) in pink, white, and black marble.
./images/15.jpg	ABBATE, NiccolÃ² dell'	Oil on canvas	"In a fabulous setting we see the last moments of a stag hunt. The very small size of the figures in the foreground does not prevent the artist from lingering over every detail of the elegant clothing, the hairstyles and the harness of the horses. We sense a refined climate of diversion that was certainly inspired by  the Estense court of the castle of Ferrara, from which ""Camerini"" this painting probably comes. The natural scenery, which shows the influence of Dosso Dossi's landscapes and numerous aspects of Flemish art, is lit up in the background by unreal flashes of light, oscillating between pale pink and gray-green, from which ruins emerge, the spires of fairytale works of architecture."
./images/16.jpg	ABBATE, NiccolÃ² dell'	Oil on canvas	King Francis I of France concentrated his patronage of art and artists on the decoration of the Chateau of Fontainebleau. To this and he imported such major artists as he could. He did get the aging Leonardo, he imported Rosso in 1530, Primaticcio in 1532, then Niccolò dell'Abbate, Vignola, Andrea del Sarto, Cellini. Some stayed, some went back; but the work they left behind was decisive in the replacement of Gothic style in France.The Fontainebleau decorations included a Long Gallery, a Ballroom and several royal rooms. Only a fraction survives, since much were destroyed in later rebuildings, and most of the paintings were drastically restored in the nineteenth century.Niccolò dell'Abbate arrived about 1552. His main contribution was his fantastic landscapes, which are a genre quite apart from either the poetic realism found in late fifteenth-century Italian pictures, or the homely kind in the background of the Raphael cartoons. They have a dreamlike quality with extremes of light and colour, rainbows and flickering storms.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 7 minutes):Cristoph Willibald Gluck: Orfeo, Act I, Orpheus' aria in G Major
./images/17.jpg	ABBATE, NiccolÃ² dell'	Oil on canvas	In this painting - which may belong to a series of landscapes painted in 1570 for the Cabinet du Roi in the Château de Fontainebleau - the artist applies the formula of a vast landscape animated by small, graceful figures. He takes as his source works by Joachim Patenier.
./images/18.jpg	ABBATE, NiccolÃ² dell'	Oil on canvas	This painting is typical of the elegant art emerging in Fontainebleau inspired by Primaticcio.
./images/19.jpg	ABBATI, Giuseppe	Oil on panel	The mid-nineteenth century in Italy was the period of the Risorgimento, the movement that culminated in Italian unification. That movement provided the political and cultural backdrop for one of the most important and influential groups in Italian art in the second half of the nineteenth century: the Macchiaioli. This group of landscape, portrait and genre painters, flourishing from about 1850 to 1880, was based on Florence. The core of the Macchiaioli consisted of eleven painters born between 1824 and 1838, most important of them among the older painters were Giovanni Fattori, Silvestro Lega, Serafino de Tivoli, and Vincenzo Cabianca, while Giuseppe Abbati and Telemaco Signorini belonged to the younger. There were some other artists associated with the group to varying extent, such as Guglielmo Ciardi, Giuseppe de Nittis, Federigo Zandomeneghi, and Giovanni Boldini. The last-named three all took their bearings from France, and eventually moved to Paris.Alongside history paintings, the early period of the Macchiaioli notably included the Castiglioncello School of landscape art, of significance in the 1860s in particular. (The school was named after the Tuscan coastal town where the artists gathered to work.) The painters of this school, among them Giuseppe Abbati, Odoardo Borrani, and Giovanni Fattori, constituted a homogenous subgroup within the Macchiaioli. At first Abbati's art was to the fore, subsequently that of Fattori.Abbati was very taken with the clear, serene light of that part of the country, and with the colours, and he was the most regular of the visitors. A typical painting of the 1860s was his Landscape at Castiglioncello.
./images/20.jpg	ABBATI, Giuseppe	Oil on canvas	To this day, the hilly Tuscan countryside is dotted with olive groves and ominous cypress trees, frequently found along roadsides and near cemeteries. Abbati chose a patch of sandy, yellow road for the foreground, where long afternoon shadows are casting the shades of other cypress trees to be imagined outside of the picture plane. Large areas of different hues are effectively played off against one another in a rather abstract fashion.
./images/21.jpg	ABBATI, Giuseppe	Oil on cardboard	Abbati painted in the cloisters of Santa Croce in Florence in 1861-62 while the monument was being restored. Numerous black and white marble blocks were strewn around the grounds, offering clear-cut shapes and sharp, elementary contrasts. Beyond the empty foreground, a row of stones is placed against the shaded walkway of the cloisters, with only the figure of a worker or stonemason as a living element in this rather abstract composition.
./images/22.jpg	ABBATI, Giuseppe	Oil on panel	More a genre painting than a portrait, this woman is standing near a fireplace resting her hands on the back of a chair, a pose that was customary in portrait photography at that time. The composition focuses on her long, bluish dress and the bonnet, held down by a black scarf, while her features are only summarily executed in large daubs of colours.
./images/23.jpg	ABBATINI, Guido Ubaldo	Oil on canvas	"In Rome it was customary to decorate church choirs on high church holidays with temporary decorations constructed of coloured papier mâché or canvas. The most famous of these are the ones created by Pietro da Cortona for the forty-hour prayer in Rome's San Lorenzo in Damaso during Holy Week in 1633. Drawings and engravings of these temporary ""sacred sets"" are the earliest evidence of the increasing tendency in the seventeenth century to transform church spaces into stages for heavenly apparitions and visions. One of the first decorations belonging to this category was the Cornaro Chapel in Santa Maria della Vittoria in Rome, designed by Gian Lorenzo Bernini. In it architecture, sculpture, and painting combine to form a theatrical whole. The saint and the angel in the famous Ecstasy of St Teresa function as the performers, while the saint's vision is entrusted to the medium of fresco, executed by Guido Ubaldo Abbatini."

He directed the European opposition to Louis XIV of France and, in Great Britain, secured the triumph of Protestantism and of Parliament.

He is best known as the pioneer of the coloured wax relief portrait miniature.He worked in Italy between 1552 and 1565, and thereafter mainly for the Habsburgs. His son Alessandro followed in his father's footsteps, also specializing in mythological reliefs, and marrying the widow of another court artist, Hans von Aachen.Thirteen of Abondio's wax portraits survive, and about sixty medals. He also made the dies for the first coinage of Emperor Rudolf II. Initially his style in metal followed that of Leone Leoni, for the façade of whose house in Milan he carved eight large atlantes in stone, but later included many other influences.

./images/32.jpg	ADAM, Albrecht	Oil on canvas	Albrecht Adam was one of the most celebrated German equestrian and military artists of the early nineteenth century. The present landscape with huntsmen returning from the hunt was commissioned around 1828 as one of a pair of hunting pictures by Felix Georg von Voss, the owner of Schloss Schorssow whose family held substantial estates in Pomerania and Prussia. In the background of the picture is a large, nine-bay country house, shown from the south-east side across the lake identifiable as Schloss Schorssow, built on the banks of Lake Haussee in Pomerania in North-East Germany.
./images/33.jpg	ADAM, Lambert-Sigisbert	Bronze	In the eighteenth century artist strove to invent new techniques, new ways to obtain results with less effort and, mainly, at less cost. Works of art were now marketable items and this raised the issue of how to market them. Porcelain thus came to used as a medium for figurines. Although they were fragile, they had the advantage of possessing colours of permanent freshness. Bronze figurines were more costly, however, they were also more resistant to blow. The technique for manufacturing them was similar to that employed for biscuit. Adam's Child was reproduced in a small size, in bronze rather than biscuit.
./images/34.jpg	ADAM, Lambert-Sigisbert	Lead	It was probably an aid to the success of the grand group of Neptune and Amphitrite for the Bassin de Neptune that it should be executed in lead. The huge lead group is all movement and action - Neptune poised as if about to rise and strike with his trident, and the whole rocky platform with its people and animals about to swing forward over the water.
./images/35.jpg	ADAM, Lambert-Sigisbert	Marble	Speedy in execution, imaginative rather than intellectual, Adam had not a wide range of ideas but he was capable of effective, if unoriginal, sculpture. His Neptune Calming the Waves reveals his ability and his limitations. Back in Paris from Rome in 1733, he completed a model the following year and the piece itself in 1737. Its debt to Bernini needs no emphasizing; nor does the piece, for all its bravura, survive too close a scrutiny of its movement and anatomy. But it has a compensating largeness of effect, despite its small scale, and a welcome vigour. It is a piece of illusionism, with its dramatic movement - Neptune advancing forward to quell the waves, instead of being balanced in the equilibrium Bernini had devised - and its bold flying swag of drapery which emphasises the action.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 3 minutes):Marc-Antoine Charpentier: Marche en Rondeau

The terracotta model for the head of Water in the Hermitage shows that the vein of poetry in Adam's 'fancy pieces' was very real. The limpid treatment of the hair, the ardent yet wistful gaze, reveal an unusual delicacy and response, perhaps more those of a modeller than a carver.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 28 minutes):George Frideric Handel: Water Music, Suite No. 1
./images/38.jpg	ADAM, Nicolas-SÃ©bastien	Bronze	It is doubtful if Nicolas-Sébastien Adam was at all inferior to his elder brother Lambert-Sigisbert. They can be fairly judged by the bronze bas-reliefs each contributed to the chapel at Versailles, where the elder's St Adelaide taking leave of St Odilo is accomplished but fussy when compared to the clearly organized, highly pictorial Martyrdom of Sainte Victoire by Niclas-Sébastien. He indeed practiced sometimes as a painter, and his orientation towards painting was apparent from his sculptural work. His bas-relief is almost a homage to Pietro da Cortona in composition, but executed in a fluent pastiche manner that is closer to Sebastiano RIcci. The dying heroine, the pagan altar, the dramatic action of the aged priest, and the whole classical atmosphere, are ready to be transmuted into another of the younger Adam's reliefs, that of Sacrifice of Iphigenia.
./images/39.jpg	ADAM, Nicolas-SÃ©bastien	Marble	Nicolas-Sébastien was the ideal choice for the tomb of Queen Catharina Opalinska, Queen of Poland and Duchess of Lorraine, set up in 1749 in the church of Bon Secours in his native Nancy. Nevertheless, his brother Lambert-Sigisbert struggled hard to be preferred to the task. But panache was not needed so much as lyricism and a gentle piety, in commemorating the quite unglamorous, humble, religious wife of Stanislas of Lorraine and mother of Marie Leczinska.Bon Secours had been built by Stanislas a few years before with the intention of its containing tombs of himself and his wife, and the church's title might have suggested to Adam the theme he was to illustrate in his touching masterpiece of a soul helped by a vision. The useless royal crown and sceptre, which had proved so barren in life, are deliberately laid aside at the moment of passing from death into immortality. The queen, made youthful again, kneels in prayer, while an angel points her way to heaven. The eagle of Poland, the incense burners that smoke with the queen's praises, are unimportant in the central depiction of a simple allegory.The juxtaposition of the person commemorated and the angel of immortality is not dramatic. In that lack of drama lies its whole point. The hand of the Lord, the revelation of eternal happiness, cannot startle someone who has waited so long for them. The queen's face expresses no surprise, only ecstasy. The angel and she are integrated into a single form, in effect a bas-relief set against the coloured marble of the pyramid; its steep lines are broken by the long undulating diagonal that runs up from the lowest fold in the queen's mantle and culminates in the extended forefinger of the angel's upraised hand.

./images/41.jpg	ADAM, Nicolas-SÃ©bastien	Marble	Adam's art was influenced by the Italian Baroque, which he had assimilated in Rome. Prometheus, the artist's presentation piece for the Academy in 1737, reveals a facile inspiration, great technical skill ostentatiously displayed, and a real sense for the decorative. His Triumph of Neptune and Amphitrite at Versailles, created with his brother Nicolas-Sebastian, is an exemplary work of French Rococo sculptural style.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 13 minutes):Franz Liszt: Prometheus, symphonic poem
./images/42.jpg	ADAM, Nicolas-SÃ©bastien	Marble	Works of minutely detailed character (fashionable in the Rococo period) became veritable 'tours de force' when the sculptor combined the almost excessive preoccupation with details with an endeavour to keep up the 'grand manner' on a reduced scale. Nicolas-Sébastien Adam spent two decades working on the presentation piece he submitted to the Royal Academy in 1762. Yet there is not a trace of weariness in his masterpiece. It has a wonderful verve, yet it is also wonderfully delicate, this miniature Prometheus on his rock having his liver devoured by a vulture. The treatment of the details, even peripheral ones like the torch smoking on the ground, is superb. There is no question that academic statuettes of this type were influential.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 17 minutes):Karl Goldmark: Prometheus Bound, overture op.38
./images/43.jpg	ADAM, Nicolas-SÃ©bastien	Marble	The architect Ange-Jacques Gabriel designed four vases, two representing spring and two autumn, for Louis XV's Château at Choisy, near Sceaux. The sculptors Jean-Baptiste Pigalle and Nicolas-Sébastien Adam each carved one on the theme of autumn (now both in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), and the Flemish-born sculptor Jacques Verberckt (1704-1771) carved the pair dedicated to spring (now in the Musée du Louvre, Paris, and in the Château de Malmaison).Like many garden ornaments of the period of Louis XIV and Louis XV, the vases are indebted to ancient precedent. The kalyx-krater form, based on an ancient Greek vase type, with fluted base and handles springing from satyrs' heads, became a paradigm for Baroque and Rococo garden ornaments.

The house was designed by the Palladian architects James Paine (1717-1789) and Matthew Brettingham (1699-1769) and was loosely based on an original plan by Andrea Palladio for the never-built Villa Mocenigo. At the time a relatively unknown architect, Robert Adam was designing some garden temples to enhance the landscape of the park; Curzon was so impressed with Adam's designs, that Adam was quickly put in charge of the construction of the new mansion.The picture shows the south front.

./images/51.jpg	ADEMOLLO, Luigi	Fresco	Luigi Ademollo, an Italian painter, draftsman, and engraver, was the uncle of the painter Carlo Ademollo (1825-1911). The Tuscan activities of this Lombard painter contributed to the establishing of modern Nea-Classical aesthetics in Florence. His decorative scenographic paintings on subjects drawn from mythology and Greek and Roman history, rich in grandiloquent archeologisms. certainly produced responses from local artists. Two representative examples of Ademollo's style and language are the painting decoration of the Palatine Chapel (1791-92) and of the later (1816) Sala dell'Arca (Room of the Ark) in the Pitti palace.Ademollo decorated the Room of the Ark with biblical scenes inspired by the history surrounding the Holy Ark of the Jewish people. Before the backdrop of classical architecture, a multitude of people are moving in a frieze-like procession with the Holy Ark being carried under the leadership of the high priest. The scenes are rich in narrative detail and reveal the artist's ability for elaborate historical recreations.

In contrast with these is the 'forest room' where a decoration of buildings and scenes of nature merges into endless greenery, creating illusory scenic prospects that rise to the changing sky of the ceiling and are lost in the dream-like images of the garden outside.The picture shows a detail of the decoration of the rooms on the piano nobile of the palazzo, entirely frescoed by Ademollo with mythological subjects, including griffins and garlands of flowers, and some 'woodland' decoration from a series of trompe-l'oeil landscapes.

./images/63.jpg	ADOLPHI, Christoffel	Silver	Michiel de Ruyter (1607-1676) was one of the most famous admirals in Dutch history. He is most famous for his role in the Anglo-Dutch Wars of the 17th century. His victories in the naval battles of the Dutch War of Independence and later during the Anglo-Dutch wars assured his place not only as a national hero, but also as one of the most respected admirals in history. His greatest military achievement was the Four Days' Battle of June 1666, which resulted in defeat for the English navy. De Ruyter was then asked to commission his own portrait in six copies, to be hung in the chambers of the regional offices of the admiralty in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Middelburg, Harlingen, Enkhuizen and Hoorn.The medal is signed on the arm with the monogram 'C.AD.F.'.

./images/65.jpg	ADRIAENSSEN, Alexander	Oil on oak panel	The style of Alexander Adriaenssen, who became a master in Antwerp in 1610, is related to the Haarlem style. He made a number of still-lifes of flowers, but he owes his reputation to his many still-lifes of fish. He depicted with great skill the moist waxiness of fish and oysters.He seems to have arrived fairly quickly at a well-laid-out scheme to which he adhered for the rest of his life. He has a striking diagonal asymmetric composition, with motifs overlapping one another and arranged over several planes, with a generally sober tonality, even tending to monochrome. In the use of some motifs he seems to have been influenced by Frans Snyders.

./images/70.jpg	ADRIANO FIORENTINO	Bronze	The obverse of this medal portrays Ferdinand II (1467-1496), Prince of Capua, Duke of Calabria, and King of Naples (1495-96), who recovered his kingdom from French occupation. A gifted humanist prince, Ferdinand was loved by the people, who affectionately addressed him in the diminutive Ferrandino. When his father, the unpopular Alfonso II, became king (1494), Ferdinand took command of Neapolitan troops opposing the advance of the French king Charles VIII in northern Italy. Failing to halt the French, Ferdinand returned to Naples and became king upon the abdication of his father on Jan. 23, 1495. The following month, however, the French captured Naples, and Ferdinand withdrew to Sicily. Aided by a Spanish army and the Venetian fleet, he recovered almost all his lands by the summer of 1496 and was received triumphantly by the populace of Naples. His sudden death opened the way for Spanish usurpation of the Neapolitan throne.The reverse of the medal depicts Felicitas Seated, Holding Ears of Corn and Waving Cornucopiae.
./images/71.jpg	ADRIANO FIORENTINO	Bronze	Adriano Fiorentino, a Florentine artist active in Naples, made an impressive bronze bust of Pontano, as well as an all'antica portrait relief in marble and a medal. Giovanni Gioviano Pontano (1429-1503) was a poet, humanist, and statesman. He was the presiding spirit of the Accademia Pontaniana, and chief minister and tutor to the Aragonese Kings of Naples. He was also the most innovative and versatile Latin poet of Quattrocento Italy. His Two Books of Hendecasyllables, given the subtitle Baiae by their first editor Pietro Summonte, experiment brilliantly with the metrical form associated principally with the ancient Latin poet Catullus. The poems are the elegant offspring of Pontano's leisure, written to celebrate love, good wine, friendship, nature, and all the pleasures of life to be found at the seaside resort of Baiae on the Bay of Naples.In all three forms, Adriano depicts Pontano as an older man, his sparse remaining hair is wavy, and his rather severe demeanour is expressed through a furrowed brow, pronounced veins and perhaps a scar at the temples, deeply creased cheeks, and a slightly downturned mouth. In the bust and relief he wears classical garb, with his cloak held at the shoulder by a fibula.

./images/74.jpg	ADRIANO FIORENTINO	Bronze	In the second half of the fifteenth century, there was a demand of sculptures of classical subjects due to the rediscovery of antique sculpture. The pose of Adriano's statuette probably was partly based on specific antique sculpture, but Venus standing on a shell shows also the influence of Botticelli's famous paintingThe Birth of Venus,now in the Uffizi.Adriano Fiorentino (Adriano de Giovanni de' Maestri) was active in Florence. This statuette is one of the rare works signed by the artist: it is inscribed underneath in abbreviated Latin: HADRIANUS/ ME.F. (Adriano/ made/ me).
./images/75.jpg	AELST, Willem van	Oil on canvas	"Willem van Aelst signed and dated this ""Ontbijtje"" (breakfast piece)."
./images/76.jpg	AELST, Willem van	Oil on canvas	In addition to fruit and flower still-lifes with cool colour harmonies, van Aelst also enjoyed painting elegant hunting weapons and dead animals placed in a dark corner by a wall for rich clients. One example is this still-life.A dead partridge is hanging by its leg from a piece of string. Its wings and feathers, which are grey with brownish patches, open up towards us at the bottom like a fan. The fly on the light-coloured feathers has an illusionist effect: disproportionately large in size, it belongs to the realistic level of the picture rather than its fictitious one, so that the viewer is given the impression that a real fly is crawling across the painting. The bird's head has been pressed slightly towards the middle by the blue hunting bag with the golden fringe and the adjustable shoulder strap which is lying on the stone shelf. Beside the partridge a hunting horn, also adorned with tassels, and a powder bottle have been hung up. The shiny, metallic grey of the hunting horn has been painted by the artist with a highly sensitive eye for the different hues of the bird's fluffy, grey feathers on its breast and as a contrast to the grey of the wings which merges into white towards the middle.But, although the bird has been rendered with almost unsurpassable precision, it has an odd abstract quality. It seems as if, in its material consistency, it had undergone a synthesis with the implement of civilization by which it was pursued - as if it was no longer merely part of nature and a victim, but an aesthetically refined and ennobled form of existence.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 9 minutes):Antonio Vivaldi: Concerto in B flat major RV 362 op. 8 No. 10 (Hunt)
./images/77.jpg	AELST, Willem van	Oil on canvas	Willem van Aelst was a still-life specialist prized for his lovely flower and fruit pieces, and he has been mentioned as a sometime follower of Kalf. He also painted a number of elegant game pictures in a clear light. They show close views of dead prey - occasionally accompanied by killed poultry - that include scrupulously painted guns, hunting bags and horns, bells and other gear of the sport. As most trophy pieces they were designed as representative pictures of the sport, not records of the spoils of a specific hunt.In this picture the painter displayed the finely worked equipment of the huntsman on a marble ledge: a velvet hunting bag with chamois strap, trimmed with gold embroidery and fringes, and a tasseled horn. Above it he suspended the exquisite catch of a fat partridge and three small game birds. The exquisite blue of the velvet contains the expensive pigment lapis lazuli, which yields ultramarine colour when ground. It was imported from China. Van Aelst's lavish use of it reinforces the preciousness of the arrangement and confirms its destination in a wealthy home. Most Dutch painters used cheaper, less stable blue pigments.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 3 minutes):Carl Maria von Weber: Der Freischütz, Act III: Jagerchor

./images/79.jpg	AELST, Willem van	Oil on canvas	The picture depicts a still-life with peaches and grapes fallen from an over-turned basket, resting on a partly-draped marble ledge. The painting has been reduced from a vertical to horizontal format, resulting in the loss of the signature.
./images/80.jpg	AELST, Willem van	Oil on canvas	Van Aelst painted this still-life (signed and dated lower right) in 1650, the year in which he entered the service of Ferdinand II de'Medici, grand duke of Toscany, and of his brother, Cardinal Carlo de'Medici. It is possible, that this painting was executed for the cardinal, who was the artist's main patron in Florence.In this still-life Van AElst continues the tradition of fruit and flower painting that flourished in Delft from the early 1630s onward with the work of Balthasar van der Ast, Gillis de Bergh, and Evert van Aelst, Willem's uncle.

./images/83.jpg	AELST, Willem van	Oil on canvas	Intense colours characterize the still-lifes of Van Aelst, who worked for a time in France and Italy. In this painting, which was commissioned by Cardinal Giovan Carlo de' Medici, the intense blue of the table-cloth catches one's eye. The large crystal vase in the centre of the composition was probably in the possession of the Medici family. The painter placed his signature and the date on the hem of the white tablecloth: W.A.Aelst. 1652.

./images/91.jpg	AELST, Willem van	Oil on copper	Although Van Aelst is most admired for elegant still-lifes with fine glassware, silver vessels, fruit and flowers, this representation of humbler motifs must be considered one of his finest early work. The subject here is a 'vanitas', with a recently extinguished candle set in a holder on a stone ledge, and a mouse nibbling at walnut crumbs.Although mice occur in 17th-century still-lifes (e.g. in paintings by Abraham van Beyeren, Georg Flegel, Jacob Vosmaer), the specific combination of a mouse and an expired candle is unique.
./images/92.jpg	AELST, Willem van	Oil on canvas	Van Aelst's still-lifes are infinitely various. Here, he perhaps suggests the category's classical roots: the Greek painter Zeuxis's grapes, so lifelike that birds tried to eat them, and the split pomegranate recalling Demeter's bargain, and announcing winter's return, as Proserpina descends to Hades once more.
./images/93.jpg	AELST, Willem van	Oil on canvas	Willem van Aelst was a still-life specialist prized for his lovely flower and fruit pieces, and he has been mentioned as a sometime follower of Kalf. The eminent flower painter Rachel Ruysch was his pupil.This floral still-life has symbolic significance. The blooms, shown in all their glory, already imply the fading and dying that is to come, a reminder of the transience of beauty. A similar idea is communicated by the holes eaten in the leaves, while the open pocket-watch serves to suggest the passage of earthly time, as well as standing more generally for the importance of good measure. Yet the hour cannot be read from the face of the watch, and this might suggest that time is not passing, that the painter has brought time to a standstill in his work, overcoming the very transience of things.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 2 minutes):Franz Schubert: Blumenlied (Flower Song) D 431

Susanna and the Elders comes from the circle of Aert van Ort and it illustrates the opening episode of the Old Testament story in which the beautiful and virtuous Susanna attracts the lustful attention of two elders. This was probably paired with another window or two illustrating the story's conclusion. Hundreds of roundels survive, suggesting that this form of relatively inexpensive domestic art enjoyed great popularity.

./images/99.jpg	AERTSEN, Pieter	Oil on wood	The fruit and vegetables presented in Aertsen's paintings are peasant foods, but they are a feast for the eyes. His market scenes are not slices of everyday life, but plausible inventions. Many of the fruit and vegetables depicted in his work have sexual connotations and some of them were eaten as aphrodisiacs.In the present painting, the artist juxtaposes the biblical narrative with a market scene, encouraging beholders to ponder the relationship between love and lust, between sexual attraction and visual seduction. The foreground of the painting is filled with sexual innuendoes. On the left side, a man shows a woman his strings of onions. Although this may look innocent and mundane, onions were commonly used as aphrodisiacs. Furthermore, according to proverbial folklore, peeling an onion was like peeling off clothes, for it could easily result in tears. On the right, a man grasps a black rooster, a phallic allusion, in one hand, and an egg basket, a vaginal allusion, in the other.
./images/100.jpg	AERTSEN, Pieter	Oil on wood	In the 16th century Antwerp rose to the position of the most significant trade and banking centre in Europe. In the area around this town there was an extensive cottage industry for the processing of English cloth and the production of glassware, soap, sugar, and other goods. The changing conditions in agriculture were almost equally revolutionary. The population increase at the beginning of the 16th century meant a greater demand for food, which had to be satisfied buy an agricultural system that was now no longer catering merely to itself but also to the market.After years of inadequate supplies the increase in food production was experienced by the general public as a great improvement - so much so, in fact, that it virtually demanded some form of artistic expression. Celebrating this new wealth in an almost solemn manner, the Amsterdam-born painter Pieter Artsen, who lived in Antwerp in 1555-56, depicted market scenes as part of biblical illustrations. However, instead of following traditional conventions and playing only a minor part in these illustrations, these market scenes dominate the biblical motifs so much that the latter are literally pushed into the background.In this painting Christ and the Adulteress, the biblical event takes place at the back, on the left, while the foreground is dominated by a market scene with peasants offering clay pots, baskets laden with fruit, vegetables such as onions, carrots, cucumbers and cabbages, as well as eggs, loaves of bread and large jugs of milk. It is this foreground which attracts our attention. There is also a peculiar mixture of time levels: the biblical scenario (with people wearing the clothes of antiquity) and the contemporary market scene (with sixteenth-century peasants) are intricately interwoven, as is shown in the Roman soldiers storming past the market stall. The same feature can be found in numerous other paintings of Aertsen.
./images/101.jpg	AERTSEN, Pieter	Oil on wood	"Firmly positioned in front of the imposing chimney-piece, the cook stands surrounded by the food she is preparing to cook: voluminous cabbages in a basket, and fowls and a leg of meat skewered on a spit which she holds firmly in one hand, whilst with the other she grabs a skimming ladle. The sculptural silhouette with its powerful arms, its solid body and vigorously modelled face radiates a strong sense of assurance. The fact that she is looking towards the unseen part of the room suggests that something is going on there that the viewer is unable to see. Pieter Aertsen made use several times of this form of composition in which a single, solidly-built figure occupies the entire panel in a vertical format which accentuates his or her solidity. This is an invention by the artist, which although originating in the foregrounds of the works of Jan van Hemessen, has no real precedent in the Antwerp painting of the period.Even though he never painted a picture not containing a human figure, Pieter Aertsen played an essential role in the emergence of the still-life by granting a dominating place to objects and to victuals, which he represents in all their triviality. Whilst every element appears to have been observed with attention to real-life detail, the image has nonetheless been recomposed in the studio. What cook would place small fowls and a heavy leg of lamb on the same spit? We also find the same kitchen utensils, furniture and victuals, differently interlinked, in many of the artist's compositions. Whilst the household objects are drawn from life, the classical lines of the chimney are taken from the architectural treaty of the Italian Sebastiano Serlio, whom Aertsen would have known from the Antwerp edition of his works in 1549.The total absence of religious subject matter, which still underlay all genre scenes at the time, is another stroke of daring by the painter, even if 16th century viewers would have immediately recognised, in the cook, the Martha of the gospel narrative, who is busy preparing the meal whilst her sister Mary is listening to Christ's words. This image also has a moralising content and should be read as a warning against the dangers of the pleasures of the flesh, ""voluptas carnis""."
./images/102.jpg	AERTSEN, Pieter	Oil on canvas	
./images/103.jpg	AERTSEN, Pieter	Oil on panel	Interiors with merry companies or drunken brawls became very popular in the 17th century, and the work of Pieter Aertsen was seen as the first step on that path. This picture shows a merry company at an egg dance. The object was to keep dance while kicking the egg round in a circle without breaking it, then covering it with a bowl, again using only one feet.
./images/104.jpg	AERTSEN, Pieter	Oil on wood	Genre-painting, as an independent subject, originated in the Netherlands in the sixteenth century. Before then scenes from everyday life had often been depicted in the background of pictures with a primarily religious content, but it was only after about the middle of the sixteenth century that many painters began to feel their principal task was to represent everyday life for its own sake. With Pieter Bruegel the Elder, also called Peasant Bruegel, genre painting came to be generally accepted and found a great many adherents in the Netherlands. Pieter Aertsen, who was born in Amsterdam and worked mainly in his native city and in Antwerp, was one of the most eminent of these. Most of his works depict market vendors, scenes at fairs or kitchen interiors, with an abundance of carefully painted still-life motifs.In this painting he depicts an old Dutch peasant taking his produce to the market, on his head a heavy tub, in his right hand a brace of mallard and a basket of eggs. A peasant girl in the background kneels by a tray of pasties or loaves. The painter has achieved an effect of monumentality by using large spots of colour and clear outlines and by enclosing his powerfully modelled figures within the confines of a narrow space. Aertsen's great virtue lies in his sincerity and simplicity, particularly noticeable if we compare his work with later genre-scenes.
./images/105.jpg	AERTSEN, Pieter	Oil on wood	
./images/106.jpg	AERTSEN, Pieter	Oil on oak	"This Market Scene - a painting in vertical format - shows a column of sea food on the left, building up and culminating in a ray and - directly opposite, on the right - a large number of fruits of the field and the garden. Wedged between this enormous abundance of produce, the farmer and his wife appear to be mere appendages whose job is only that  of proudly pointing with silent gestures to the victuals that are on offer.The ostentatious wealth of fruit and vegetables in the market scenes of Aertsen and Beuckelaer may lead to the false conclusion that the population had plenty to eat. But although more was being offered on the markets, this did not meet the demands of the urban population, who had to pay exorbitant prices for agricultural produce in comparison to what they actually earned. And so, the horn-of-plenty motif of these market pictures reflects far more the perception of those who benefited, that is, the newly-rich farmers. In this way the artist emphasized the commercial aesthetics of agricultural products from the farmers' fields and gardens, products that were meant to arouse in the viewer the desire to buy, though not in the sense of present-day advertising.However, this does not exclude the possibility of ambivalent reasoning behind such paintings. While stimulating people's cravings and appealing to their needs, they often contained a subtle element of criticism, particularly in Aertsen's biblically motivated pictures. This criticism concerned the contradiction between people's consumer habits and the demand of temperance (""fasting""). While this critical element was still obvious in Aertsen's paintings, it seems to have disappeared almost completely in Beuckelaer's.This painting has a multiple theme. The abundance of the market could be at the same time a representation of the Four Elements and an allegory of the Five Senses. Also the market woman is being pestered by a bird-catcher, who is gripping a duck round the neck with obvious erotic overtones - as well as a realistic representation. The painting is also a moral lesson, extolling moderation and restraint in contrast to the physical and sensual pleasured offered, for instance, in the plumpness of the fruit. In other paintings Aertsen introduced a religious scene in the background by way of admonition."
./images/107.jpg	AERTSEN, Pieter	Oil on oak wood	
./images/108.jpg	AERTSEN, Pieter	Oil on oak	The painting is an Ecce Homo fragment. Similarly to other biblical paintings of Aertsen, the biblical event takes place at the back, while the foreground is dominated by a market scene.. Somewhere in the background, the picture - cut off at the top - affords a small glimpse of the platform where the masses are shouting 'Barabbas' (John 19:4-6). This is optically overlaid by the bow-shaped arrangement of carts and market stalls - a reversal of emphasis which is typical of Aertsen.
./images/109.jpg	AERTSEN, Pieter	Oil on wood	The painting demonstrates a wide range of agricultural products, made possible by the improvements in production methods. Offering her fruits and vegetables, the woman is almost an appendage to her produce. Despite all exaggeration, the picture quite adequately shows the new economic prosperity of the time. At the same time, however, it still contains a background scene in genre style of embracing lovers in a stable, thus relating the painting to late medieval peasant satires. Peasants were regarded as lustful, sensuous and carnal by the middle classes.
./images/110.jpg	AERTSEN, Pieter	Oil on panel	In the 16th and 17th centuries it was quite common for theologians to see a slaughtered animal as symbolizing the death of a believer. Allusions to the 'weak flesh' (cf. Matthew 16:41) may well have been associated with Aertsen's Butcher's Stall where - like on his fruit and vegetable stalls - a seemingly infinite abundance of meat has been spread out.In this picture, the viewer's senses are immediately assaulted by the profusion of life-size comestibles. Amid fowls, sausages, beef, pork, fish, butter, cheese and pretzel, the eye of a flayed ox's head disconcertingly seems to watch the viewer. Each object is a masterful still-life. Like Lucas van Leyden and some other Netherlandish artists, Aertsen inverted the traditional foreground-subject relationship; his narrative occurs in the background. Almost unnoticed at first, the stall permits glimpses of a tavern on the right and a landscape behind. The ground around the inn is covered with oyster and mussel shells, which in some context - as here - allude to their consumption as an aphrodisiac. Among the tavern's revellers is a prostitute with a possible customer.Meanwhile, groups of people, dressed in contemporary Netherlandish attire, walk through the countryside towards the church visible at the far left. Only the mother riding the donkey stops to give alms to the poor. She is the Virgin Mary. Led by Joseph, she and her son are journeying to Egypt, to escape Herod. This is a very different presentation than the standard flight into Egypt since no idols fall, no miracles occur, no angels or servants direct the way. Although beset by their own troubles, the Holy Family shares what they have with the less fortunate. No halos signal their divinity, rather, Aertsen accented their humanity to construct a moral about daily personal decisions. His pilgrimage of life offers a choice between a materialistic and morally questionable existence on the one hand and the spiritual path of the Holy Family on the other.Aertsen and Joachim Beuckelaer, his nephew and pupil, popularized peasant and market scenes such as this, which typically contain half-hidden moralizations and religious themes. Through their impetus in Antwerp and Amsterdam, where they painted, peasant and market scenes evolved into a separate artistic specialization around the mid-sixteenth century.
./images/111.jpg	AERTSEN, Pieter	Oil on wood	Pieter Aertsen was a Dutch painter who had a workshop in Antwerp for several years. He painted altarpieces, but also peasant scenes with a moralizing undertone and kitchen still-lifes with religious themes in the background. He continued this work following his return to Amsterdam in around 1557, concentrating henceforth more on the latter genre. This painting may have been produced during his Amsterdam period.The subject of the work has long been debated, although we can be sure it is not simply a peasant scene. it was once believed to be a portrait of the artist's family, but that hypothesis was rejected some time ago. The scene has all the elements of a rural booze-up. Much drink is being consumed, sausages grilled and bacon fried. There are festive biscuits on the table and a tray of waffles. Crowns like the one worn by the boy were used on the Feast of Epiphany, but also during other winter festivities, including Shrove Tuesday. Neither holiday is being celebrated here, however. The bird-cage next to the door on the left tells us that the scene is taking place in a house of ill repute, such as a tavern or brothel. Other elements combine to suggest the latter - the way the young man places his arm around the girl's waist, the copious eating and drinking, the aggression symbolized by the man with the two weapons, and the foolishness reflected by the king's crown. Like many of Aertsen's paintings, this work has both a moralizing and admonitory content, revealed by the presence of three men of different ages, each symbolizing a generation, around one woman.There is some remarkable innovation in this painting. The figures in the foreground are shown full-length in the middle of the small space, which, together with the monumental format, testifies to the emancipation of non-religious themes in painting around this period.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 26 minutes):Johann Sebastian Bach: Cantata BWV 212 (Bauernkantate)
./images/112.jpg	AERTSEN, Pieter	Oil on wood	A remarkable feature of this painting is the the still-life and a biblical scene (here Christ with Mary and Martha) composed together. The effect of the compostion was strongly disturbed by cutting the lower part of the painting (about 9 cm was cut for unknown reasons).
./images/113.jpg	AERTSEN, Pieter	Oil on panel	In the 1550s Pieter Aertsen produced several major altarpieces, however, little remains of them, since many were destroyed in the Iconoclasm of 1566. Two panels are in the Rijksmuseum which once belonged to the same triptych with the Adoration of the Magi: the larger being the central panel, the other the left wing. On the reverse side of the left wing the scene of Circumcision (or the Presentation in the Temple) can be seen.

He made something of a speciality in painting exotic animals, and was a frequent visitor to the menageries which were such a feature of London Life at this date.
./images/122.jpg	AGNOLO DI POLO	Gilt and painted terracotta	This figure of Mary Magdalene is one of the few extant documented works by Agnolo di Polo. It was made for the Ospedale della Morte in Pistoia in 1495. Documents show that the officers of the Sapienza in Pistoia ordered a terracotta figure of Mary Magdalene to be made for the oratory attached to the Ospedale della Morte on August 16, 1495. A local master, Bernardino del Signoraccio, painted the figure next year, 1496.The figure suffered damage in 1498, and Agnolo repaired it in 1500 and replaced the broken right hand with one in wood.

But whereas the the Mary of Valois monument has its place in the context of court art, the Tarlati monument belongs in the democratic tradition of Tuscan sculpture. Lacking the refinement and elegance of Tino's tomb, it celebrates in simple, graphic style Tarlati's administration.

./images/154.jpg	AIVAZOVSKY, Ivan Konstantinovich	Oil on canvas	Towards the 1850s the romantic features in Aivazovsky’s work became increasingly pronounced. This can be seen quite clearly in one of his best and most famous paintings The Ninth Wave.

./images/162.jpg	AKOTANTOS, Angelos	Tempera and leaf on panel	"In the years that preceded the Turkish conquest of Constantinople and the ultimate fall of the Byzantine Empire, the Byzantine state had been restricted to the areas around Thrace and the Morea. The difficult circumstances and the insecurity that reigned led the artists of the Capital to seek safer places and new markets. Crete, an island which had been under Venetian domination since 1210, and which was flourishing economically, was one such place. Archival sources mention at least six painters from Constantinople who lived and worked at Chandax (the medieval name for the present-day city of Herakleion in Crete) at the beginning of the 15th century; among them were John Apokaukos and Nicholas Philanthropenos. The wave of ""artistic migration"" which went on even after the fall of Constantinople to the Turks (1453), led to the spread of the art of the Capital to the island and was a contributing factor in the creation of a particular school of painting, known as the ""Cretan School"", which was to dominate the art scene of the post-Byzantine years.Among the artists who lived and worked at Chandax during this period, worth mentioning is the painter Angelos. More than 15 icons found today on Crete, Naxos, Patmos, Zakynthos, and in museums and private collections, bear his signature - ""cheir Angelou"" (by the hand of Angelos) - or are attributed to him on the basis of their stylistic features. The great number of icons leads us to suppose that Angelos must have had an important workshop in Chandax. Additional information on the painter is provided by the Venetian archives. In them there is a will, dated 1436, signed by one Angelos Akotantos, who has been identified with the painter whose name appears on the icons."

./images/170.jpg	ALBANI, Francesco	Fresco	The picture shows the painting on the ceiling vault of the piano nobile loggia in the Palazzo Verospi, painted by Francesco Albani. The depictions are: Phoebus-Apollo and Personifications of the Seasons in the centre panel; Genii of Morning and Evening Twilight in the ovals; The Planetary Gods; Genii of Morning and Night with their Children Sleep and Death in the spandrels.Since antiquity, colonnades and porticoes with painted decoration have been distinguishing features of the palaces of ruling houses. In the seventeenth century the main focus in the painting of a loggia, an indispensable feature of the piano nobile in palaces and villas in Rome and elsewhere, was the vault. The original pattern for the Roman loggia was theloggia of the Villa Farnesina,painted by Raphael with free-floating figures in the spandrels and caps of the vault. The piano nobile loggia in the Palazzo Verospi, painted by Albani follows this pattern, but borrowings from theceiling of the Galleria Farnese,fromReni's AuroraandGuercino's Auroraare also present.
./images/171.jpg	ALBANI, Francesco	Fresco	The ceiling painting represents Jupiter and Ganymede. The architectural painting was executed by the specialist Angelo Michele Colonna.
./images/172.jpg	ALBANI, Francesco	Oil on canvas	Albani was a painter belonging to the Bologna school. He was influenced by Domenichino and Raphael, and worked in the workshop of Annibale Carracci in Rome.
./images/173.jpg	ALBANI, Francesco	Oil on copper	Albani painted many versions of this subject. One of the best is the large altarpiece in the church of San Bartolomeo in Bologna, to which this painting is closely related.

./images/175.jpg	ALBANI, Francesco	Oil on copper	
./images/176.jpg	ALBANI, Francesco	Oil on copper	The composition and figural types of this Holy Family or The Rest on the Flight into Egypt, especially the statuesque Madonna, owe much to Annibale Carracci, while the soft modeling and freshness of colour, emphasized by the luminosity of the copper support, is highly characteristic of Albani.
./images/177.jpg	ALBANI, Francesco	Oil on copper	Small, highly finished cabinet pictures were a specialty of Albani's production and proved to be enormously popular with collectors, especially in France.  Many were painted on copper, a technique he had learned during his years working in the studio of Denys Calvaert, a Flemish artist who had settled in Bologna and operated a successful workshop.This devotional image of the Holy Family appears to have been particularly popular and it is known in a number of variations.
./images/178.jpg	ALBANI, Francesco	Oil on canvas	Albani is a typical representative of the reform movement introduced by Carracci. As a student of the Bolognese artists and a colleague of Annibale who collaborated on the decoration of the Aldobrandini lunettes, he had developed a degree of confidence in his choice and application of stylistic means that allowed him not only to handle large wall areas, but also to create small and intimate devotional pictures.In his Sacra Famiglia or Holy Family Albani finds that characteristic blend of sovereign grace and delicacy that today's spectator may find slightly disturbing. Those of us who regard such emotional emphasis and charm with some suspicion tend to forget the specific tasks and needs these pictures were intended to fulfil in order to satisfy a highly educated and cultivated group of buyers. The usual setting for pictures on this theme was a niche in the bedroom of a patrician house or palace intended for devotional purposes. This function also explains some of the typical traits of such a picture: the intimacy of a family gathering, framed by fragments of great architecture, the gestures of devotion of the two angels and the meditative attitude of the elderly Joseph - all signals with which the contemporary spectator would have been able to identify clearly.
./images/179.jpg	ALBANI, Francesco	Oil on canvas	Francesco Albani, a follower of the Carracci in Bologna, was famous and popular with his contemporaries for his graceful, if somewhat sentimental religious and mythological paintings.
./images/180.jpg	ALBANI, Francesco	Oil on canvas	This painting was probably painted as a pendant to Annibale Carracci's Landscape with Diana and Callisto (collection of the Duke of Sutherland, St Boswells). Carracci developed the composition of The Toilet of Venus several years after his Landscape with Diana and Callisto, and the greatest part of its execution was left to Albani, his pupil. ALbani later painted his own interpretations of Carracci's mythological inventions.
./images/181.jpg	ALBANI, Francesco	Oil on canvas	In 1621, Ferdinando Gonzaga, the Duke of Mantua, commissioned a series of The Story of Venus for his Villa Favorita. Completed in 1633, these pictures are enlarged versions of the round compositions of a cycle formerly executed for the prince Borghese towards 1615-17. The Toilet of Venus belongs to the series.

./images/183.jpg	ALBANI, Francesco	Fresco	The picture shows the view of the Galleria, looking south. Between the doors the scene depicting the Sirens is visible.Vincenzo Giustiniani (1564-1637) was one of the most brilliant, and knowledgeable lovers of art in early seventeenth-century Rome. He assembled a renowned collection of roughly 1.800 works of classical sculpture and 600 paintings, among them eleven of Caravaggio's most important works. He purchased a villa at Bassano Romano in 1595 which was then thoroughly remodeled and enlarged. The artists who painted there between 1595 and 1604 all worked in the Mannerist style.The north wing of the enlarged palace was erected in 1607-09 and the painted decoration was accomplished in 1609-10. There are three rooms in the north wing, the Sala della Felicità Eterna (painted by Paolo Guidottiin 1610), the Sala di Diana (painted by Domenichinoin 1609) and the Galleria (painted by Francesco Albani and assistants in 1609-10).In the Galleria, Albani painted the legend of Phaethon, the youth who disrupted the path of the sun. The protagonists in Albani's wall pictures are seen reacting with violent gestures and upward gazes at the central event of the fall of Phaethon on the ceiling. The entire Phaethon legend, as related in Ovid's Metamorphoses, is illustrated on the ceiling and walls in episodes that are part dramatic, part lyrical. Albani designed the eight scenes on the walls as imaginary tapestries.Albani's cycle was highly praised through the whole of the eighteenth century. Later the Phaethon cycle and its painter came to be forgotten, and have only now rediscovered by art historian and appreciated anew.
./images/184.jpg	ALBANI, Francesco	Fresco	In the Galleria, Albani painted the legend of Phaethon, the youth who disrupted the path of the sun. The protagonists in Albani's wall pictures are seen reacting with violent gestures and upward gazes at the central event of the fall of Phaethon on the ceiling. By contrast, the assembly of gods in heaven is comparatively static - except for the figure of Phaethon plunging earthward upside-down. Apollo has raised an arm as a sign of his sadness, and Jupiter is flinging his thunderbolt. Mercury is pointing at the tumbling youth.

./images/192.jpg	ALBEREGNO, Jacobello	Tempera on panel	From the demolished church of San Giovanni Evangelista on Torcello, the polyptych portrays with exemplary clarity one of the visions described by St John in the Book of Revelations.
./images/193.jpg	ALBEREGNO, Jacobello	Tempera on panel	The picture shows the central panel of the Polyptych of the Apocalypse. In the centre of the polyptych is God the Father in Glory with the Lamb, between the symbols of the four Evangelists.The ineffably expressive naturalness which makes the central panel of Alberegno's signed triptych so admirable appears again in the panels of the Polyptych with five episodes from the Apocalypse, originally placed in the church of St. John the Evangelist at Torcello. In the central panel for example, where St. John the Evangelist looks up from his writing to admire the Eternal in glory with the Lamb of God, surrounded by the symbols of the four Evangelists with wings covered with eyes, being worshipped by twenty-four venerable old men, here too the theme, though very complex, comes through with exemplary clarity because of the subtle expressiveness of the details which frees the sacred vision of every transcendent abstraction.
./images/194.jpg	ALBEREGNO, Jacobello	Tempera on panel	Even more in the four minor panels of the Polyptych of the Apocalypse the transcendental significance of the gold background pales before the freshness and inventiveness of Jacobello Alberegno's imagination. As with the other scenes, so with the 'Harvest of the World', the text of the Book of the Apocalypse (XIII, vv. 17-18) is closely followed: 'And another angel came out of the temple... and he too had a sharpened sickle. And another angel came out from the altar... saying: wield your sharpened sickle and harvest the grapes of the world, for the fruit is now ripe'. The detailed and penetrating transcription of the sacred text into pictorial form seems to be softened by the enchanting addition of an arbour of black grapes with bunches of the fruit hanging heavy with juice and leaves which are already showing signs that Autumn is drawing to a close.
./images/195.jpg	ALBEREGNO, Jacobello	Tempera on panel	Much more of an innovator than either Catarino or Lorenzo Veneziano was Jacobello Alberegno, who in the Triptych with Crucifixion and Saints, his only signed work, reveals himself to be an artist of penetrating refinement. If it is true that the two lateral saints, St Gregory and St Jerome, are examples of stylized Gothic figures, the images of the small central panel display a naturalness worthy of one of the best of Giotto's disciples. An extraordinary human dimension seems to govern the expression of sentiments in the picture: a grief-stricken St John the Evangelist clutches his cloak to his breast while the Virgin extends imploring arms and stares transfixed with anguish at her crucified son.
./images/196.jpg	ALBERTI, Antonio	Fresco	The oratory at the west edge of the city centre of Urbino was erected c. 1393. Nothing is known about the commissioning of the paintings on the walls, acycle depicting scenes from the life of St John the Baptist.The unidentified patron was probably from Rome from where the Salimbeni brothers, Lorenzo and Jacopo, came to Urbino for this commission. Stylistic analysis tells us that another painter was also engaged for the wall frescoes in the oratory. Antonio Alberti was responsible for the scenes from the St John cycle on the left-hand wall and on the inner façade.The picture shows the view of the left-hand (east) long wall of the oratory with fragments of the St John cycle in the upper register. The scenic compartments are considered to be the work of Antonio Alberti.The lower register of the east wall includes several votive pictures, separately framed but also painted on the wall, that must have been executed at roughly the same time as the cycle. The two votive paintings with an enthroned Madonna and saints were painted by the Salimbeni brothers.

./images/201.jpg	ALBERTI, Giovanni	Fresco	The Sala Clementina in the west wing of the Vatican Palace was painted between 1596 and 1602 by the quadratura painters Giovanni and Cherubino Alberti. In the centre of the illusionistic ceiling opening St Clement is depicted in glory, framed by a number of virtues and by huge cartouches with the papal coat of arms.
./images/202.jpg	ALBERTI, Leon Battista	Photo	"In 1470 Alberti produced designs for the basilica of Sant'Andrea in the centre of Mantua. The site was particularly important to Ludovico Gonzaga (1412-1478), marquis of the city, because it stood close by the Gonzaga palace and contained a relic, the supposed Blood of Christ.Alberti's design for the façade of Sant'Andrea, like that of the Rimini Temple for Sigismondo Malatesta, draws its inspiration from Roman triumphal arches, but the Mantuan church takes the idea much further, its design at once more monumental and more complex, adapting a classical form rather than seeking to replicate it.

./images/206.jpg	ALBERTI, Leon Battista	Photo	Alberti furnished the design for the façade of the church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence. The white-and-green marble structure is the only Florentine church façade on a grand scale to be built during the Renaissance. In its basic design Alberti followed the Romanesque but classicising façade of San Miniato al Monte, a church overlooking Florence, and divided the structure into an arcaded lower story surmounted by a temple design of pilasters crowned by a pediment. It is here that we see the name of the patron (Giovanni Ruccelai) in huge Roman capitals. Between the two stories he inserted a mezzanine that serves as an attic for one floor and a base for the other. Alberti framed the second-story temple on either side by large volutes, an ingenious solution to a problem that had perplexed designers of basilica façades for a millennium: how to unite a narrow upper story with a wider lower story and at the same time mask the sloping roofs of the side aisles.When Alberti received this commission, he apparently had to keep two Gothic elements: the side portals of an earlier design and six pointed-arched tomb niches, three to either side of the main door, He absorbed these into his Renaissance design by enclosing the niches within a round-arched blind arcade and by repeating their horizontal green-and-white banding in the pilasters on both levels.
./images/207.jpg	ALBERTI, Leon Battista	Photo	The very large church of the Santa Maria Novella was the first important and independent church in truly Italian style. Its construction began in about 1246 for the Dominican Order. The exact dates of the various parts of the church are still controversial but it certainly took a very long time to build it. The nave was not begun until 1279, and the façade, began in 1310, was not finished until 1470. Nevertheless, the interior and the plan make it the most important church of its date.

./images/209.jpg	ALBERTI, Leon Battista	Photo	The many Roman buildings derived from Alberti's innovations create a link between Alberti and the more grandiose Rome of the High Renaissance and the Baroque. Interestingly enough, none of the architects of these Roman buildings has been securely identified. The courtyard of the Palazzo Venezia in Rome, built after 1455, at a time when Alberti was still connected with the papal court, imitates the arcades and engaged columns of such nearby Roman buildings as the Colosseum and the Theater of Marcellus.This courtyard was designed by an architect from Alberti's circle.
./images/210.jpg	ALBERTI, Leon Battista	Photo	The façade of the Palazzo Ruccelai is a strikingly original contribution to the history of Renaissance palace design. The façade's general principles were followed in many other buildings, some actually built, others merely designed. The basic elements are a rusticated three-story building with an entrance portal and high, square windows on the ground floor, mullioned windows on the second and third, and a massive cornice. The three stories are of equal height, and the rustication is identical in all three stories.According to ancient Roman practice, Ionic was placed above Doric, and Corinthian above Ionic, thus the ground story of Palazzo Ruccelai is Doric (or Tuscan) and the third Corinthian. The second story displays graceful capitals of Alberti's invention composed of acanthus leaves grouped about a central palmette, a fitting intermediate stage between Doric and Corinthian.The palace belonged to a wealthy Florentine merchant, Giovanni Ruccelai.

./images/214.jpg	ALBERTI, Leon Battista	Bronze	Alberti's first appearance in Florence was in 1434, the year of Cosimo de' Medici's return from exile. It was apparently during his time in Florence that Alberti executed a large self-portrait medal in bronze. He shows himself in strict profile, wearing a classical cloak, as indicated by the knot, and a severe haircut based on classical models. Alberti was clearly in the vanguard of artistic developments, for this is one of the earliest, if not the earliest, of Renaissance portrait medals, and also the first independent self-portrait by a Renaissance artist and the first to show the artist dressed in the antique style.The winged eye to the left is Alberti's emblem; the L. Bap. to the right, which is framed by two smaller eyes, refers to his name.

This includes the notable tempietto del Santo Sepolcro (Small temple of the Holy Sepulchre, inspired by the church of the same name in Jerusalem), also by Alberti, covered by polychrome marbles and tarsias.

./images/218.jpg	ALBERTI, Leon Battista	Photo	In 1450 Alberti was given an opportunity to put his classical ideas into visible form in an ambitious structure, the San Francesco in Rimini, called Tempio Malatestiano, that, although unfinished, is known today through amedal by Matteo de' Pasti.In its curvilinear silhouette the façade has no parallel in either Florence or Rome and in this respect is sometimes regarded as an innovation. However, medieval façades of similar shape are in fact relatively common in North Italy, where Alberti had spent his youth. In the precise arrangement of the lower storey, with arches on piers, applied half-columns and roundels in the spandrels, the design is directly dependent on the nearby ancient Arch of Augustus, thus establishing a parallel between antiquity in Rimini and its revival there under Sigismondo Malatesta. Its triumphal associations are presumably deliberate and would refer both to the Christian idea of life triumphant over death and to the Classical idea of fame triumphant over oblivion. The arcaded system of the façade is continued along the sides of the building, although without the half-column articulation. This difference establishes an appropriate architectural distinction between façade and side elevation.View theaxonometric drawingof the planned Tempio Malatestiano, Rimini.

./images/220.jpg	ALBERTINELLI, Mariotto	Panel	This is an early work of the artist. Featuring the Virgin adoring the Child with the help of an angel who hands him some of the instruments of the Passion, it is formally rather weak in its awkward spatial and figural relationships.
./images/221.jpg	ALBERTINELLI, Mariotto	Tempera on panel	The Virgin and Child are represented beside a window with a landscape beyond. The landscape shown through the window at right is painted with a remarkable looseness. The trees, some fine and long limbed, others made full with layered rows of browning leaves, are reminiscent of those in the background ofFra Bartolomeo's Noli Me Tangerein the Louvre. Albertinelli and Fra Bartolomeo set up a workshop in the 1490s. They appear to have been close friends and the two operated under an equal partnership.

./images/223.jpg	ALBERTINELLI, Mariotto	Oil on wood	Mariotto Albertinelli, the pupil of Cosimo Rosselli, ran a workshop with Fra Bartolomeo, and like him shared an interest in the painting of Perugino, whose illuminating example is apparent in this work, unanimously considered to be his masterpiece. However, we cannot fail to notice also the monumentality of the figures and the geometrically divided landscape, influences, these, of Fra Bartolomeo. The spatial breadth is still characteristic of Perugino, but the narrative content is more vigorous.

The small, full figures are firmly and vigorously placed in scenes which respect the most rigorous perspective laws of the Florentine Quattrocento.

./images/227.jpg	ALBERTINELLI, Mariotto	Oil on panel	This signed and dated painting is an autograph variant of Albertinelli' most celebrated work, the Visitation in the Uffizi, Florence, which is dated 1503 but not signed. Just five years after executing the Uffizi prototype, which shows the undeniable influence of Perugino in its use of soft highlights and its inclusion of a classical arcade, the artist returned to the subject using the same cartoon but introduced some fundamental differences to the design: the architectural niche and the landscape have been removed and two additional figures have been introduced. While the central figures may wear robes different in colour and detail from the prototype, they are very much faithful to the original in their harmonious pyramidal design which balances both movement and stasis. Interestingly, the face of Elizabeth in the present work is no longer in shadow as it is in the Uffizi version.The lateral figures may be the work of Giuliano Bugiardini, who is known to have rented quarters next to Albertinelli in 1503 and began assisting him shortly thereafter.

Eighteen volumes containing over 2.900 of Aldrovandi's watercolours show both how wide-ranging his interest was and how precise his observations were in cataloguing the specimens that were kept in his natural history ""museum"" and in the University's botanical garden, founded in 1587. His drawings are instructive as a measure of the perceived possibility that one could, indeed, catalogue nature completely, one specimen at a time piling up in endless sheaves of drawings.The picture shows a page from a volume of drawings."

./images/252.jpg	ALGARDI, Alessandro	Marble	Algardi's portrait busts are much less flamboyant or self-consciously artistic in character than those of Bernini. Where Bernini sought movement and engagement in his portraits, Algardi's approach was more understated, and more concerned with evoking presence through minute attention to physiognomy. His busts seem more aloof because they functioned generally as part of funerary monuments where meditation and piety were the primary requirements.The hallmarks of his approach to portraiture were established by the mid-1630s, when he created the bust of the papal advocate, Monsignor Antonio Cerri, and the posthumous portrait of Cardinal Giovanni Garzia Mellini.The bust of Cerri is an example of the sculptor at his most skillful, moving from the precisely defined modelling of the head and crisply carved folds of collar and drapery to the passages of hair and skin which appear to have issued from a brush rather than a chisel. The downward turn of the head indicates that the bust was once intended to be seen from Cerri's wall monument, but in the event the original was kept back and an inferior copy from Algardi's shop was placed on the tomb.

The work was much admired in Algardi's day, and the critic Bellori praised the illusion of the deceased 'almost kneeling, in the act of praying to the altar'. The bust conveys a sense of Baroque piety and an assured technique: the lace appearing at the Cardinal's sleeves and the short cape carelessly folded behind his left hand are brilliantly observed, and such details contribute to the uncanny sense of a physical presence in the niche.

./images/265.jpg	ALGARDI, Alessandro	Marble	The combination of minute attention to detail and miraculous tonal control are the most engrossing feature of Algardi's busts. When the need arose, he cold also produce a striking performance, as in the splendidly imposing bust of Donna Olimpia Maidalchini, one of the greatest portraits of the period. Disagreeable and domineering, Donna Olimpia did not exude charm, but as the sister-in-law of Pope Innocent X she was a power in Rome during his reign. Algardi transmutes his unpromising sitter into an image of majesty and determination, the tilt of her head and the expression of her face being amplified by a billowing veil. Unusually, Algardi reverses the normal approach to flesh and drapery tones by giving the latter a bright, milky sheen and leaving the former matt. This transposition was dictated by Algardi's emphasis upon the veil which is so integral to the bust's impact.

This appealed to Madame Du Barry, who obtained the Venus and placed it at Louveciennes, and commissioned in 1772 from the sculptor a pendant of virtually the same subject in less languorous mood: a Diana surprised by Actaeon (also in the Louvre, Paris), completed five years later and then exhibited in the artist's studio.

But the strongest influence on Allegrain came from Poussin.
./images/286.jpg	ALLEGRAIN, Etienne	Oil on canvas 	In the last decades of the seventeenth century the ideal landscape of Claude Lorrain was continued by painters such as Étienne Allegrain and Pierre-Antoine Patel (Patel the Younger) who added to it a new type of artificiality which was almost eighteenth-century in character.
./images/287.jpg	ALLORI, Alessandro	Fresco	The twenty-five-year old Ottaviano de' Medici, on behalf of Cardinal Giulio de' Medici and his cousin Pope Leo X, commissioned Andrea del Sarto, Franciabigio and Pontormo for decorations celebrating the pope's father, Lorenzo the Magnificent, and other family members inside the family's villa at Poggio a Caiano. The iconographical programme, designed by the historian Paolo Giovio, aimed to evoke the celebrations of the Medici house through a series of episodes drawn from Roman history.Work in the Salone was halted with the death of Leo X in December 1521. Pontormo was the only one to have finished his lunette fresco, frescoes by Franciabigio and Andrea del Sarto on the long walls were partially incomplete. The decoration was completed by Alessandro Allori in 1578-82, a commission of Grand Duke Francesco de' Medici.Allori first completed the existing parts of the frescoes by Franciabigio and Andrea del Sarto together with those he planned, then he painted two large scenes, The Banquet of Syphax on the long wall containing Franciabigio's The Return of Cicero to Rome, and Titus Quinctius Flamininus's Speech before the Achaeans on the long wall containing Andrea del Sarto's Triumph of Caesar. In both scenes Allori placed the events in a large columned hall that opens up onto a landscape.Finally, he painted the lunette on the wall opposite to Pontormo's lunette. It is a formal pendant to Pontormo's work, he took over the horizontal articulation, the number of figures, even the colours of their garments. The theme of the lunette is Hercules and Fortuna beneath the Tree of the Hesperides.The picture shows the long wall with Allori's The Banquet of Syphax and Franciabigio's The Return of Cicero to Rome, as well as the wall with Pontormo's lunette.

./images/289.jpg	ALLORI, Alessandro	Fresco	Allori's The Banquet of Syphax is located on the long wall of the Salone containing Franciabigio's The Return of Cicero to Rome. Allori placed the event in a large columned hall that opens up onto a landscape. He perhaps found his inspiration in Venetian painting, in particular, Paolo Veronese's depictions of banquets.Syphax was a king of the ancient Numidian tribe Masaesyli of western Numidia during the last quarter of the 3rd century BC. His story is told in Livy's Ab Urbe Condita (written c. 27-25 BC). In his twenty-eighth book Livy records that Scipio, coming from Carthage, was surprised to encounter Hasdrubal, who had retreated from Spain before the Romans, at the court of the Numidian prince Syphax. Their host was flattered that both combatants had sought his support. He invited Scipio and Hasdrubal to share a meal, where the scene that Allori depicted took place. The two bitter enemies  took their meal on the same triclinium.
./images/290.jpg	ALLORI, Alessandro	Fresco	Allori's Titus Quinctius Flamininus's Speech before the Achaeans is located on the long wall containing Andrea del Sarto's Triumph of Caesar. Allori placed the event in a large columned hall that opens up onto a landscape.Titus Quinctius Flamininus (c. 229 BC-c. 174 BC) was a Roman politician and general instrumental in the Roman conquest of Greece. This historical scene shows us Titus Quinctius Flamininus, the victor at Cynoscephalae at a meeting with the Achaeans in Aigon in 192 BC, where he so convinced the Achaeans with his speech that they decided to consider the enemies of Rome as their own enemies as well and declare war against them. This is an analogy to Lorenzo de' Medici's appearance at the Congress of Cremona in February 1483, where he once again demonstrated his powers of persuasion on the stated fighting Venice in the Ferrarese War (1482–84).

./images/295.jpg	ALLORI, Alessandro	Oil on copper	"In this painting the angels are dressing the dead Jesus. The subject is Byzantine in origin and rare in Western art. The mattress, covered with red velvet is a stylized variant of the ""red-stone"" relic, formerly in the Byzantine Pantokrator church. According to an apocryphal legend, Christ was lying on this stone when the angels anointed him and covered him with the shroud. The legendary event, shown on the small painting on copper, is supplemented with a liturgical reference: on the altar in the background, we can see a chalice, symbolizing the mystery of the Eucharist.Alessandro Allori works with definite contours, models like a sculptor and paints numerous small details.The painting is signed in the centre of the altar-step: ALESSANDRO BRONZINO ALLORI FACEVA."
./images/296.jpg	ALLORI, Alessandro	Oil on canvas	It is not easy matter to identify the beautiful, golden-haired Florentine woman wreathed with flowers like Flora or Spring as the Christian Church, or the boy with the languishing satiated look as Christ, betrothing himself to her and rejecting the Synagogue. In the interpretation of Allori, a late Mannerist, the pious subject acquired a strong character of courtly romance.
./images/297.jpg	ALLORI, Alessandro	Fresco	Pure genre scenes like the view of women hanging clothes to dry or combing their hair in the vault of a loggetta in the Palazzo Pitti are extremely rare in the monumental form of fresco decorations in the sixteenth century. Comparable scenes are, however, regularly found as elements of landscapes or grotesques.This stunning room was originally an open loggia leading on to the Boboli Gardens, and located in the South wing of the Palace. It was designed to house the “Apartments for Foreign Princes and Cardinals” (Guest Apartments). It boasts the oldest painted decoration in Pitti Palace, commissioned from Alessandro Allori by Ferdinand de’ Medici shortly before he became Grand Duke. In the centre of the vault, a trompe l’oeil depicts a terrace that opens out under the sky and, along the balustrade, various female figures as they perform everyday activities. The highly naturalistic elegance with which animals and some items – such as the candelabras filled with numberless species of flowers – are shown, together with the sheer quality of the execution make this ceiling one of the most extraordinary examples of Florentine Mannerist painting in a private setting. In the centre of the vault, a pair of angels are lifting the Cardinal’s coat-of-arms into the skies, surrounded by a wide variety of birds. Idealised landscapes decorate the walls in an easily narrative style, but also with a wealth of extremely modern naturalistic details, modelled on Flemish experiences, as translated in Florence by Paul Bril. The excellent quality of the frescoes means this work can certainly be attributed to Alessandro Allori, even if some sections are by workshop artists. Restoration work in the 1990s brought to light the illusory decorations that reproduce the balustrade on the outer side of the ancient loggia, as well as the brilliance of the original colours.
./images/298.jpg	ALLORI, Alessandro	Oil on copper	What strikes us in this portrait is the convincing compromise between the formal purity acquired from Bronzino, the predilection for enlarged forms drawn from Michelangelo, and the balanced, rhythmic spatial models of Raphael, for Allori was a truly skilled alchemist in combining these various influences in a dignified way.The lady portrayed is certainly Bianca Cappello, already painted by Allori in a fresco which now hangs in the Tribune of the Uffizi.On the back of the portrait is an allegorical scene, the Dream of Human Life.

./images/300.jpg	ALLORI, Alessandro	Fresco	Grand Duke Francesco I de' Medici was a man of profound and obsessive passions. The Uffizi galleries, which he established, were one, Bianca Cappello (1548-1587), his mistress, and afterwards, the second wife, was the other.
./images/301.jpg	ALLORI, Alessandro	Oil on lead with gold leaf	Francesco I (1541-1587) was the son of Cosimo de' Medici and Eleonora di Toledo and ruled as second Grand Duke of Tuscany from 1574 until his death in 1587. The present small tondo was probably a gift from Francesco to his sister Lucrezia on the occasion of her marriage to the Ferrarese Duke Alfonso II d'Este in June 1588.

At the same time he did many portraits among them that of Tommaso de' Bardi and of his wife Ortensia Montauti.
./images/303.jpg	ALLORI, Alessandro	Oil on canvas transferred from wood	Formerly the painting was attributed to Agnolo Bronzino. The sitter was assumed to be either Grand Duke Cosimo Medici II (1590-1621) or Grand Duke Ferdinando Medici (1551-1609). These assumptions are, however, not proven.
./images/304.jpg	ALLORI, Alessandro	Oil on copper	In a nocturnal scene, John the Baptist preaches the coming of Christ. He holds the standard of the Resurrection above a lamb representing Christ's sacrifice. Allori seems to have looked back to the Mannerist for his palette, to Michelangelo for his figures, and to northern Europe for his landscape.
./images/305.jpg	ALLORI, Alessandro	Oil on copper	In this work, as often occurs in the painting of Allori, the composition is slightly over-emphatic. Saint Peter, kneeling in the foreground, enveloped in his billowing garments, seems in fact to be acting on a stage. The setting, instead, is made pleasant and gracious thanks to an almost archaic use of perspective, to that sea rising high on the horizon, ruffled by light foaming waves, and to the small boat, tossed by the waters, brimming with small figures.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 21 minutes):Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina: Missa Brevis (Tu es Petrus)
./images/306.jpg	ALLORI, Alessandro	Oil on slate	The Studiolo is a tiny chamber in the Palazzo dei Priori (Palazzo Vecchio), accessible by a hidden spiral staircase. It was dedicated to the geological, mineralogical and alchemical interest of Francesco I de' Medici, son and successor of Cosimo I. Its walls are lined with two tiers of oil paintings on slate or panel that act as doors for cupboards containing Francesco's scientific books, specimens, and instruments.Alessandro Allori's contributions to the decoration of the Studiolo in the Palazzo Vecchio included the Pearl Fishers.Allori was the follower of Agnolo Bronzino, and his style imitates the cool, smooth manner of his teacher. Exquisite male and female nudes, human and mythological, play about on rocks, dive off boats, and bring up shells overflowing with seawater and pearls. Over and over the figures quote Michelangelo (the central nude seen from the back comes straight out of theBattle of Cascina), but only in the most playful way. The echoes of theDeluge on the Sistine Ceilingare transformed by Allori's predominantly pink and blue colouring.

./images/308.jpg	ALLORI, Alessandro	Fresco	The Vasari Corridor was built in 1564 by Giorgio Vasari in only five months at the time of the wedding between Francesco I de' Medici and Giovanna of Austria; it served to link up the Pitti Palace, where the Grand Duke resided, with the Uffizi (or offices) where he worked.It is a covered walk, almost a kilometre in length, an overhead passageway that starts out from the West Corridor of the Gallery, heads towards the Arno and then, raised up by huge arches, follows the river as far as the Ponte Vecchio, which it crosses by passing on top of the shops. On the other side of the Arno, the corridor passes through the interior of the church of Santa Felicità, and finally reaches the Boboli gardens and the apartments in the Pitti Palace.This detail of the decoration of the corridor represents mixed beings (hybrids) frequently created in the Mannerist period by painters of grotesques. They are part of the decoration of the made by Alessandro Allori and his workshop.

./images/311.jpg	ALLORI, Cristofano	Oil on canvas	Judith with the Head of Holofernes has been described as the most celebrated of all Florentine seicento pictures. It exists in numerous versions, the best known being that in the Palazzo Pitti, Florence, painted for Grand Duke Cosimo II. The primacy of the version in the Royal Collection, however, depends principally on the vividness of the characterisation, the freshness of colouring, and the numerous changes effected during the course of painting even after several preparatory drawings had been made. Many of these changes are visible to the naked eye and accord with early descriptions of Allori's working methods. By contrast, the version in the Palazzo Pitti is slicker and more self-assured as a result of following an established design.The painting's reputation is derived from the autobiographical aspect of the treatment of the subject as recounted by Filippo Baldinucci (1625-96) in his Notizie de' professori del disegno da Cimabue in qua. Baldinucci records that Allori was essentially a libertine who was given to occasional bouts of piety. Regarding the subject of the present picture he states that the figure of Judith is a portrait of the painters lover, Maria di Giovanni Mazzafirri (died 1617), known as 'La Mazzafirra' that the features of the servant are those of La Mazzafirra's mother, and that the head of the decapitated Holofernes is a self-portrait of the artist. In essence, the composition commemorates an unhappy liaison and symbolises the suffering that Allori experienced at the hands of La Mazzafirra.The story of the Jewish heroine Judith, who saves her townspeople the Bethulians by cutting off the head of the Assyrian general Holofernes, is recorded in the Book of Judith found in The Apocrypha. The subject was frequently represented, sometimes as a straightforward narrative, sometimes with an allegorical (usually political) significance. The double meaning in the painting by Allori is confirmed by a poem by Giovanbattista Marino (La Galena, 1619), written in Paris where he saw one of the versions. Marino writes that Holofernes is killed twice, firstly by Cupid's darts and secondly by the sword. It is a theme that continues in literature certainly up to John Keats's La Belle Dame sans Merci. The female artists Lavinia Fontana and Artemisia Gentileschi depicted themselves as Judith, and there is an autobiographical element in the Judith by Jacopo Ligozzi of 1602 (Florence, Palazzo Pitti). Similar opportunities arose in the treatment of the subjects of David and Salome. Caravaggio, for instance, in the David and Goliath dating from 1605-06 (Rome, Galleria Borghese), used his own features for the head of Goliath. This last is a composition that Allori knew.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 17 minutes):Alessandro Scarlatti: La Giuditta, oratorio, Part I (excerpts)
./images/312.jpg	ALLORI, Cristofano	Oil on canvas	"Cristofano Allori trained in the school of his father and his grandfather, the leading Florentine Mannerist Agnolo Allori, known as Bronzino. Even if Cristofano may be regarded as an artist who broke with late Mannerist tendencies and went on to become an express proponent of early Baroque reform ideas, he nevertheless continues to borrow certain traits of ""Mannerist physiognomy"" in order to heighten the effect of a picture. In his most famous painting, Judith with the Head of Holofernes, the extreme contrast between the dark and bearded head of Holofernes and the angelic face of his murderess owes much to the Mannerist school in which he was trained.Allori is said to have created a portrait of his mistress Mazzafirra in the figure of Judith and her mother in the figure of the elderly servant woman. The head of Holofernes may be a self-portrait. If this is true, the picture would certainly be a classic example of the so-called ""portrait historié"" in which real figures are presented as figures from history. Whether or not this is true, the significance of this painting lies predominantly in the enormous erotic tension that emanates not only from the faces of Judith and Holofernes, but also from the sensuality with which the Old Testament heroine is portrayed. This major theme of triumph over tyranny had never before been presented from this point of view.This is the only painting from the long neglected Florentine school of the seventeenth century whose reputation has always remained at the highest level, and it therefore gained a sort of symbolic value. Moreover, its fame as a masterpiece of the Seicento spread beyond regional borders, thanks in part to its temporary confiscation and subsequent display in the Musée Napoléon in Paris between 1799 and 1815. The work is by far the best of the many existing versions, copies, and derivations. Although it is not the prime version of this much-painted composition, it is possibly the only fully autograph surviving example.Allori, a Florentine, painted this canvas during Artemisia Gentileschi's stay in Florence, and surelyknew her version.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 17 minutes):Alessandro Scarlatti: La Giuditta, oratorio, Part I (excerpts)"
./images/313.jpg	ALLORI, Cristofano	Oil on canvas	The most famous painting by Florentine artist Cristofano Allori, carried out between 1610 and 1612, became an instant success and was widely copied, due in part to the popularity of the legend of the biblical heroine Judith which the artist interpreted autobiographically; the decapitated head of Holofernes is a self-portrait while his lover Mazzafirra is portrayed in the beautiful face of the young woman, whose extraordinarily luxurious clothing is a direct tribute to the city's thriving textile industry.This work by Cristofano acknowledges his influence from Caravaggio through the teachings of Artemisia Gentileschi who, in the same period in the service of the Medici family, painted two violent interpretations of Judith for Cosimo II. Cristofano emphasizes the heroine's beauty, the candour of her skin tones and the exquisite quality of her clothing, contrasted against the horror of the decapitated head she holds in her hand. Judith appears proud of her deed and sure of her divine protection.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 17 minutes):Alessandro Scarlatti: La Giuditta, oratorio, Part I (excerpts)

The principal Spanish exponent of this style was the sculptor Sebastián de Almonacid, whose name first appears in 1486. He is the author of the double tomb of the Constable Alvaro de Luna and his wife in Toledo cathedral, and is thought to have carved the tomb of Martin Vázquez de Arce in Sigüenza cathedral. The idealized realism of the effigy is one of the supreme achievements of Spanish plastic art.

./images/324.jpg	ALSLOOT, Denis van	Oil on copper	Cephalus and Procris were in Greek mythology a young couple, newly married, whose love was destined to end in tragedy. The figures in the painting are probably by another hand most likely to be Alsloot's principle collaborator, Henderick de Clerck.
./images/325.jpg	ALSLOOT, Denis van	Oil on oak panel	The forested landscapes of Alsloot often incorporate views of castles and abbeys located in the Foret de Soignes, near Brussels, a frequent source of inspiration. The building depicted with topographical accuracy in its lakeside setting in the present painting can be identified as the château at Tervueren, an important site tied to the Brussels court.As in many of Alsloot's paintings the figures are probably the work of Alsloot's principal collaborator, Hendrik de Clerck.
./images/326.jpg	ALSLOOT, Denis van	Oil on panel	From the late fifteenth century the landscape genre had a great development in Flanders. In many cases landscapes of the period not only showed the nature that surrounded the artists but also the population, both peasants and the upper classes, performing different activities. The snowy landscape, a typical Flemish genre, showed the people in their outdoor activities despite the cold. The scenes of skaters and carnivals became associated with this type of snowy landscapes.Denis van Alsloot, painter to the archducal court in Brussels, was a prominent landscape painter. The scene depicted in his Skating during Carnival takes place in Antwerp, identified by the walls built with Charles V and the Church of St. Jacques. What we see is a social scene where the characters perform different activities, highlighting the skaters with colourful carnival costumes. The clothing of most of the characters indicates that this is the entertainment of the upper classes. Many of the clothes that the characters wear come from Spanish fashion, but there are also some typical Flemish garments.

./images/330.jpg	ALTDORFER, Albrecht	Panel	A family of satyrs has settled on a tree-covered slope at the foot of a cliff. The man with horns and goat's feet is shown holding a club, while a blonde woman nestles against him and supports the child standing on her thigh. The couple seem to be oblivious of a scene taking place in a nearby meadow, where a woman in a red dress is attempting to flee from a naked man who is carrying a stick in one hand and holding her fast with the other.The uninhibited way of life of human or semi-human beings in the freedom of natural surroundings was a frequently occurring theme in literary and pictorial works of the Renaissance, following the precedent of antiquity. German artists became familiar with subjects of this kind mainly through copper-engravings by Andrea Mantegna and other northern Italian artists. By no means all these themes were derived straight from antiquity; frequently they were mythological fantasies inspired by Roman relief sculpture.The whole atmosphere of Altdorfer's idyllic scene suggests that it was inspired not so much by engravings as by the Arcadian landscapes of Venetian painters of the school of Giorgione; yet, although the motif of the naked woman seen from behind seems to confirm this, Altdorfer's approach to his art is fundamentally different. The satisfaction of depicting the nude, for which scenes from antiquity provided the most obvious pretext, is entirely subordinate in Altdorfer's paintings to his rendering of nature. The figures, which are fairly summarily treated, remain small and relatively inconspicuous against the dense wooded background. Whether the painter actually visited Venice is not certain but it does seem highly likely. About 1500 he was working in the Salzburg region at the Mondsee monastery, before he acquired burgher's rights in Regensburg in 1505. The present work, produced two years later, is one of Altdorfer's earliest signed and dated paintings. Like Cranach's Rest on the Flight, painted in 1504, it points the way to a new awareness of landscape in the Renaissance period, originally stemming from the so-called Danube school.Around the middle of the last century this portrait was in the Kraenner Collection in Regensburg; it later passed into the collection of Barthel Suermondt, which was purchased for the Berlin Gallery in 1874.

./images/332.jpg	ALTDORFER, Albrecht	Parchment on wood	With a sentimental note and an intuitive science of light and colouring, the masters of the Danube school, Altdorfer and Huber, gave free rein to their lyricism in scintillating mythologies and religious scenes, in which the landscape acquires an importance never before equalled, and vibrates with a completely personal communion with nature.Altdorfer became a citizen of Regensburg in 1505, and later the Surveyor of the city's buildings. The steeply wooded stretch of the Danube below the city, with the castle of Worth, appears in several Altdorfer paintings.
./images/333.jpg	ALTDORFER, Albrecht	Wood	Altdorfer placed biblical and historical scenes into German landscapes, and the figures were represented in contemporary dresses. As an exampée, this well-known biblical scene takes place in the garden of a Renaissance palace.
./images/334.jpg	ALTDORFER, Albrecht	Oil tempera on wood	This is the most famous painting of Altdorfer. Its subject is the victory of the young Alexander the Great in 333 B.C. over the Persian army of King Darius in the battle of Issos. The battle in fact took place in Turkey, however, on this painting it is shown in the rocky environment of the Alps with German cities in the background.The viewer, endowed with telescopic vision, witnesses the battle and the cosmic landscape. The ebb and flow of battle makes it difficult initially to distinguish the two sides. Altdorfer dressed the Macedonians like German knights and landsknechts (mercenary foot-soldiers), while the Persian warriors sport turbans and exotic attires. Hundreds of riders and foot-soldiers skirmish within sight of their battle standards. Darius' chariot, with mounted steel blades, cuts a path through the throng. Alexander, riding on Bucephalus, and some of his knights are in close pursuit. Darius escaped but at great cost: according to the tablet above, 100.000 Persian soldiers and 10.000 riders died. Although the actual toll was lower, Darius' army was decimated and his family was captured.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 12 minutes):Heinrich Ignaz Franz von Biber: The Battle, suite

./images/338.jpg	ALTDORFER, Albrecht	Oil on limewood	Albrecht Altdorfer was one of the great German masters of the 16th century. Although remaining within the orbit of Dürer's influence, Altdorfer began a trend in painting which focused on the representation of nature, which he interpreted - in an almost Romantic style - as something living and moving. This development became known as the Danube school and Altdorfer was its principal representative.
./images/339.jpg	ALTDORFER, Albrecht	Linden panel	The small diptych represents the Stigmatisation of St Francis (left panel) and the Penitence of St Jerome (right panel). In the diptych the two saints are seen close-up, in contrast with the infinite space of their landscape settings.Altdorfer belongs to a small group of German artists for whom landscape assumed great importance, both for helping to set the emotional tone of a narrative scene, and for its own sake.
./images/340.jpg	ALTDORFER, Albrecht	Parchment on lime panel	Altdorfer was one of Germany's most innovative artists in an era spanning late medieval piety, the Renaissance and the Reformation, and his work reveals many facets of a changing society. It is especially noteworthy for an expressive use of nature and for introducing landscape as a theme of its own in art. In this respect Altdorfer is the central figure of the Danube school.The forest was the outdoor setting most favoured by Altdorfer, and it sets the tone of many subjects both secular and religious.
./images/341.jpg	ALTDORFER, Albrecht	Oil on panel	The Virgin is shown resting in a throne-like chair by a richly ornate Renaissance fountain, while Joseph proffers a basket of cherries. Several angels are playing in and around the basin of the fountain, and the child Jesus tries to reach into the water. The fountain-pillar is lavishly decorated with sculpture. The significance of the group of figures at the top - a bearded man with a boy shooting an arrow - is not clear, but appears to relate to ancient mythology. Beyond the fountain the wooded shores of a lake stretch far into the distance. The rocks are crowded with gateways, fortified roads and towers, houses with pointed gables, ruins and decaying roofs - all so intricately interwoven with trees and foliage that it is difficult to detect the relationship of any one building to the other.The element of fantasy, which so dominates the landscape, is also apparent in the fountain, in which the figures seem to be drawn both from reality and from the artist's imagination. There is no prototype or parallel in Altdorfer's time for the bizarre appearance of the fountain. The painter's artistic invention was sin this case at least a generation ahead of his time.At the foot of the fountain is a stone tablet bearing the Latin inscription: 'Albertus Aldorfer pictor Ratisponensis in salutem animae hoc tibi munus diva maria sacravit corde fideli 1510 AA' ('Albrecht Altdorfer, painter from Regensburg, for the salvation of his soul dedicated this gift to thee, divine Mary, with a faithful heart');.this indicates a very personal confession on the part of the painter, his appeal to the Virgin Mary. The dedication must also be taken as an explanation of the central feature of the picture, the fountain, which - though symbolic of a heathen place - is nonetheless the water of life for the Holy Family. The motif recalls the legend, according to which a spring appeared from the earth when the Holy Family in its flight sought a place to rest. A few years earlier Cranach had treated the same theme;this fact establishes a singular bond between the two paintings.It is assumed that the landscape reproduces impressions from the country near Regensburg, and in particular the hamlets of Scheuchenberg, Lerchenhaube and Wörth, which are also recognizable in Altdorfer's Crucifixion in the gallery at Cassel. The painter settled in Regensburg in 1505 and twenty years later was appointed the city's master-builder. Most of his pictures point to a predilection for architecture and architectural décor. An example of this is the highly imaginitive construction of the fountain and - on another panel in Berlin painted somewhat later - the ruin in the darkness which serves as the setting for the birth of Christ.

./images/343.jpg	ALTDORFER, Albrecht	Linden panel	Staged as a nocturne, this Nativity takes place in a stable so ruinous that an additional miracle may be found in its not having collapsed upon the Holy Family sheltering within. The stable clearly enjoyed a loftier function before housing ox, ass, and homeless family, probably first built in Bethlehem as part of the palace of David, ancestor of the Virgin.

At the foot of the cross, where in other such works one finds the skull of Adam, said to have been buried at Golgotha and whose sins Christ atones for by his death, is their coat of arms, with a hexagram. On either side of Christ, who is represented not in an idealised manner but with the signs of his injuries, the landscape stretches away into the far distance.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 3 minutes):Guillaume Dufay: Hymn for Easter
./images/347.jpg	ALTDORFER, Albrecht	Limewood	The picture shows a detail of the landscape behind the cross. Altdorfer is considered to be one of the founders of the German landscape painting that emerges in the early 16th century, the great achievement of which is the representation of nature in its concrete reality, essential for the later development of art.
./images/348.jpg	ALTDORFER, Albrecht	Wood	Apart from Dürer, Cranach and Grünewald, Altdorfer was the most significant German artist of the sixteenth century: a gifted painter, a graphic artist and the founder of the Danube School. He worked in Regensburg on the Danube, painting altarpieces and Biblical and historical scenes, and he was also the first landscape painter in the modern sense.The Crucifixion is a composition with numerous figures depicted against a golden background. This works illustrates very fully his fresh manner of representation and narration. Altdorfer painted several Crucifixions, but it is possible, on stylistic grounds, to date this version to around 1520. The symmetrical arrangement, with the cross in the centre of the composition, the crowd surging round it and the golden background (an unusual feature with Altdorfer) give the work a peculiarly archaic character. As in some of his engravings, the painter borrowed several of the figures and motifs from Mantegna.The painting was commissioned by Peter Maurer, Provost of Sankt Florian for his private chapel. It is signed with the artist's monogram at bottom right.

./images/355.jpg	ALTDORFER, Albrecht	Oil on panel	Very few portraits by Altdorfer are known. In this painting the image of the woman is a strange one, despite the apparent normality of the sitter, who has the air of a countrywoman. The cold light which illuminates her and the contrast with the background, with its sketchy and barely decipherable shadows, contribute to this mood.
./images/356.jpg	ALTDORFER, Albrecht	Oil on wood	One of Altdorfer's most ambitious commissions involved the execution of panels for the altarpiece in the Collegiate Church of Saint Florian near Linz, which was installed in 1518. Originally the ornate shrine must have resembled the greataltarpiece of Saint Wolfgangby Michael Pacher, with an elaborate framework intricately carved about painted panels, and inner sculptures, but only the paintings remain intact. Now dismantled, most parts are at either Sankt Florian or Vienna.When the wings are opened, eight episodes from the Passion of Christ appear in two registers; closed, four scenes in the life of Saint Sebastian are presented. The predella displays four more painted panels, including the Entombment and Resurrection, Saints Margaret and Barbara, and the donor, Provost Peter Maurer. Altdorfer's drama of the Passion is intensified in emotion and superbly composed with four scenes that takes place in the darkness and four opposing scenes on the right, which occur in daylight.The first of the series, Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane, is one of the finest examples of the artist's expression in themes of betrayal and violence. The threatening darkness of the night sky, striated by intense layers of red, does not conceal the nature of the sinister landscape of Gethsemane. In the foreground an eerie grotto of stalactites forms the uneasy stage for Christ and his three apostles, Peter, James, and John.
./images/357.jpg	ALTDORFER, Albrecht	Oil on wood	"One of the main concerns of the German artist Albrecht Altdorfer was to paint atmospheric landscapes. In the Arrest scene of the St Florian Altarpiece, which today survives only in fragments, the light from the torches throws up a night scene in a forest covered by a somberly glowing night sky. This kind of dramatic interpretation of the subject matter was just the sort of model Holbein needed for his Passion altarpiece.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 11 minutes):Georges de la Hele: Missa ""Nigra sum"""

They are not belong to the St Florian Altarpiece executed by Altdorfer for the abbey church in Sankt Florian near Linz, Austria. It is not known whether this altarpiece was also painted for the same church.Albrecht Altdorfer was a painter who tended to specialize in landscape and architecture to such an extent that these elements, from being simple background decorations, often became the central theme of his paintings. The dramatic and enchanted images that were the hallmark of his style caused him to be considered one of the precursors of Romanticism.Altdorfer's fantastic, visionary art represented the other side of sixteenth century culture. In his paintings he borrows the extremely vivid colours from dreams, the narration becomes impassioned, and the space-time elements narrow and expand irrationally.Particularly noteworthy is the crystalline clearness of the colours, especially the whites, which contribute to giving the story and the whole scene a somewhat unreal atmosphere.

Passers-be recovered his body which was watched over by an eagle until taken away for burial. He was said to have miraculously put out the flames of a burning building, or a whole city, with a single bucket of water. He is thus invoked against fire. He is a popular saint in Austria and Bavaria.
./images/363.jpg	ALTDORFER, Albrecht	Woodcut with five tone blocks	The Beautiful (or Fair) Virgin of Regensburg was a thirteenth century Byzantine icon of the Virgin and Child, believed to have been painted by St Luke. Many miracles (74 were documented in 1519 and 731 in 1522) were credited to this icon and hundreds of thousands of pilgrims from Bavaria, Franconia and Bohemia came to Regensburg.Albrecht Altdorfer, then member of the city council, designed tokens sold to the pilgrims and at least four different prints of the Beautiful Virgin. The finest, most expensive of these was a chiaroscuro woodcut, which in is first edition was printed with tone blocks in blue, red, green, brown, and yellow-brown. The icon is set within an elaborate Renaissance-style frame. The accompanying prayer reads, 'You are of perfect beauty my love and there is no blemish in you. Hail Mary.' Regensburg coat-of-arms and Altdorfer's monogram appear to either side.
./images/364.jpg	ALTDORFER, Albrecht	Etching	Landscape was an interest of German artists of the beginning of 16th century. Lucas Cranach and Albrecht Altdorfer had discovered the beauty of the Alpine districts around the Danube and developed a kind of romantic landscape painting and etching, often enlivened by dramatic effects of light. An interest in dramatic nocturnal scenes is also apparent in the works of Dürer's follower, Hans Baldung Grien.
./images/365.jpg	ALTDORFER, Albrecht	Etching with watercolour	Painters of theDanube schoolmade landscapes a central feature of their works. Landscape became valued for its own sake. Figures and narrative content are often absent. Most of Altdorfer's landscapes are fantasies rather than records of actual towns or places. In this etching he presented a plausible view of a village by a small river with a well-fortified castle above. Conjuring up memories of the German or Alpine countryside, it is a setting for the imagination's delectation.
./images/366.jpg	ALTDORFER, Albrecht	Woodcut	Like in his paintings, the unity of figure and landscape can also be seen in Altdorfer's woodcuts. Even though the figure of St George thrusts a long lance into the dragon's mouth across the main foreground, he still does not stand out from the mountainous setting. The plumes of his helmet meld into the foliage.

./images/374.jpg	ALTICHIERO da Zevio	Fresco	The Adoration of the Magi is located middle right on the entry wall of the chapel.Altichiero always gave his figures space, in the sense of room to move, along with this freedom of movement are their characteristic serenity and deliberate quality, which is strongly reminiscent of Giotto's figural ideal. A good example of this is the Adoration of the Magi, in which one can clearly see how Altichiero has combined the Giottesque character of the figures with the penchant for narrative detail that is more in tune with the taste of his own time. He does this by directing the attention of the viewer to the retinue of people from the Orient, to the humble appearance of the stable, and to the clothing, with its often contemporary, ultrafashionable cut and high-quality materials. Furthermore, in order to denote the specific locality, the painter allows the walls and towers of Bethlehem to rise beyond the mountains.

./images/376.jpg	ALTICHIERO da Zevio	Fresco	The Crucifixion scene is located on the altar wall. The grouping and the gestures of the figures are characterized by a particularly high level of sophistication. In the distinct contrast between the serene pose and inward-focused expression of the crucified Christ, on the one hand, and the agitation of the mourning angels on the other, we still feel the influence of theCrucifixion fresco in the Scrovegni Chapel,though the added thieves and crowd gathered below the crosses conform to the archetype of the densely populated paintings of Golgotha that in the meantime had become common in Trecento painting.
./images/377.jpg	ALTICHIERO da Zevio	Fresco	Six of the seven paintings on the northeast wall (left to the entrance) are devoted to the life and martyrdom of St George. The picture shows St George Baptizes the King and His Family (top) and St George Liberated by Angels from Torture on the Wheel (bottom).According to the Golden Legend, the king had a large church erected in honour of the Virgin Mary and St George. The three-aisle basilica shown in cross section in the middle segment of the baptizing scene's expansive architectural backdrop, with its lofts, galleries, pulpits and all sorts of attached structures, is an allusion to this church.The St George cycle continues in the lower register of the wall with images depicting the saint being sentenced to various tortures. However, neither the cup of poison given to St George nor torture on the sword-studded wheel is capable of doing the condemned saint any harm. Two angels intervene and the wheel breaks into pieces, causing the commander, the torturers, and the onlookers to shrink back in horror.
./images/378.jpg	ALTICHIERO da Zevio	Fresco	Six of the seven paintings on the northeast wall (left to the entrance) are devoted to the life and martyrdom of St George, beginning with St George Slays the Dragon in the upper register of the wall. It is characteristic of Altichiero that he did not limit the scene to the figures of the knight slaying the dragon with his lance and the princess; he added a rocky landscape that stretches deep into space at the left of the image and, as a counterpart to this on the right, included a fantastic image of the city of Silene from whose walls the king and his wife, as well as the inhabitants of the city, follow with frightened looks the battle taking place before the city gate.
./images/379.jpg	ALTICHIERO da Zevio	Fresco	In this scene, most of those present are wearing traditional garb of the period; moreover, several of these figures are presumed to be portraits of contemporaries. Similarities wwith theportrait of Petrarchin a contemporary codex, the man dressed in dark red behind St George can be identified as Petrarch, while the figure beside him on his left may be his secretary and pupil, Lombardo della Seta.
./images/380.jpg	ALTICHIERO da Zevio	Fresco	This scene is located in the lower register of the northeast wall.St George was beheaded before the city gates. This scene is vividly depicted in the last fresco of the northeast wall. Soldiers with their upright spears and lances, officers on horses, and several citizens form a compact wall of people around the saint, who kneels on the ground deep in prayer. Above the saint's lowered head, the executioner raises his sword and is readying himself to deliver the deadly blow.Here Altichiero shows most  interestingly the influence of Giotto in the solidity of his groups of figures posed in large natural spaces. He achieves brilliant results with this technique, softened by Gothic details. In addition to this, the Veronese painter took pains to portray everyday feelings. Notice the way the father takes his son away from the scene of the macabre torture.
./images/381.jpg	ALTICHIERO da Zevio	Fresco	On the southwest wall opposite the St George cycle are four scenes depicting the work and martyrdom of St Catherine (in the upper register) and that of St Lucy (in the lower register). The picture shows the scenes St Catherine Liberated by an Angel from the Torture on the Wheel (top) and The Martyrdom of St Lucy (bottom).The first two pictures, dedicated to St Catherine, are in very poor condition; they show the saint appearing before Emperor Maxentius to condemn idolatry and her dispute with the philosophers summoned by the emperor and their conversion. These scenes are followed by the picture of an angel intervening to prevent Catherine's torture on the wheel and the beheading of the saint. Both scenes have parallels in the St George cycle, here, however, an oriental milieu, seen in the physiognomies, head coverings, and scimitars, is emphasized still more.The first Lucy scene in the lower register shows the steadfastness of the saint before the judge Paschasius, the second and unsuccessful attempt to have her brought to a brothel with a team of oxen. These scenes are followed by the martyrdom of the saint, and the concluding scene is her burial. In the martyrdom scene she survives torture by flame and boiling oil, unscathed, and is then stabbed to death.

Numerous citizens dressed in contemporary garb are present at the funeral ceremony, and some of their faced have unmistakably portrait-like features. This applies particularly to the figures in the left half of the image, among whom Giovanni de' Lupi, the brother of Bonifacio, and Giovanni Dondi, the famous doctor who was an intimate friend of Petrarch, are to be recognized.

./images/385.jpg	ALTICHIERO da Zevio	Fresco	The frescoes in the Cappella di San Giacomo (Chapel of St James) were commissioned by Bonifacio Lupi di Soragno and his wife, Caterina dei Franceschi. The architecture, designed by the Venetian sculptor and architect Andriolo de' Santi was commissioned in 1372. This chapel was begun in 1372 in a privileged location inside the Basilica del Santo opposite the Cappella di Sant'Antonio (Chapel of St Anthony) and was completed, along with its painted decoration, in 1379.The painting school of Padua can be ranked as the most vigorous of the northern Italian schools: the painters of Padua built upon Giotto's achievements. The prolific Paduan fresco painters added striking naturalistic observations of their own in landscape, in the painting of animals, and in portraiture. The most successful painters of the period came to Padua from outside - Jacopo Avanzi from Bologna and Altichiero da Zevio from Verona. In the Chapel of St James, to Avanzi have been attributed most of the lunettes of the Life of St James, painted about 1374, while to Altichiero has been assigned the huge Crucifixion and some of the other lunettes.
./images/386.jpg	ALTICHIERO da Zevio	Fresco	The Veronese painter Altichiero studied Giotto's frescoes in Padua and borrowing from them developed new forms of pictorial architecture. Around 1380, he and Jacopo Avanzo painted a cycle of frescoes in the Chapel of San Giacomo in the Santo (the church of Sant'Antonio) in Padua. The group compositions of his Crucifixion are those of Giotto's figures, but the architecture is structured so that it seems to recede ever deeper into the background of the picture. Only a stone's throw from the chapel, the young Titian was to work in the Scuola del Santo in 1511, where he was deeply impressed by Altichiero's colour scheme and composition.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 3 minutes):Guillaume Dufay: Hymn for Easter
./images/387.jpg	ALTICHIERO da Zevio	Fresco	The Crucifixion above the altar extends across three of the five bays of the Chapel of San Giacomo, functioning as an enormous altarpiece. Although rich in anecdotal detail and portrait-like renderings, the fresco does not include the crosses of the two thieves who were crucified with Christ, concentrating instead on the central sacrifice. The cross is set in the foreground of a broadly coherent space which extends in greater and greater depth as it moves to either side, culminating in a hilltop castle on the far right and a firmly rendered and believably scaled pedestrian bridge, city gate, walls, and towers on the far left.

./images/391.jpg	ALTICHIERO da Zevio	Fresco	Before his stay in Padua, the Veronese painter Altichiero painted frescoes in Verona, including  the votive fresco of the Cavalli family in Sant'Anastasia.Partially ruined by the insertion of a canopied tomb in about 1390, the fresco is the collective votive offering of the Cavalli family from Verona. The men of the family, in armor, are before the Virgin. The family's patron saints accompany the faithful and their nonchalant movements contrast wonderfully with the stiff votive posture of the kneeling knights. The setting is also splendid, showing an imaginary fourteenth-century palace complete with galleries and pavilions.

To mark this visit, a large number of temporary triumphal arches were built, modeled on the monuments created to greet the archducal couple Albert and Isabella to Flanders in 1599. The visit of the Spanish king initiated a vogue for the Flemish Baroque. An example of this is the façade of Nossa Senhora dos Grilos in Porto, started in 1622, which is a creation of Baltasar Álvares.

He places the sitter in an interior, with a window through which we can see a stormy and mountainous landscape painted in soft blue tones, which become blurred as they recede into the background. The sitter is seated and looks out at the viewer, leaning on the edge of a table. The various objects around him refer to his profession. Matthäus Schwarz was accountant to the Fugger family, Germany's leading financiers, and was also the author of number of treatises on economics.

The Divine Institutions (Divinarum Institutionum Libri VII), written between 303 and 311,is the most important of his writings.The bound manuscript contains 207 folios, the frontispiece is on folio 5r and contains a vignette, rectangular in format (100 x 77 mm), showing Lactantius at work in his study. The scene has an airy effect due to the vivid colours - the violet walls, the starry blue vault, and pink-tiled floor. The margins of the folio are adorned with continuous trellis of blue, green, and pink vines, with yellow roses, on a black background. The medallion on the right depicts a struggle between a centaur and a dragon. The initial M is inscribed inside a rectangular picture field with a white vine-leaf pattern.

./images/418.jpg	AMERLING, Friedrich von	Oil on canvas	"Amerling was the favourite court painter and from 1830 one of the most popular artist in Vienna. His reputation was based on the life-size portrait of Emperor Franz in 1832. In this portrait the traditional Baroque attributes of a royal portrait are combined with a depiction of ""natural man"". This is what makes the portrait unconventional.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 11 minutes):Modest Mussorgsky: Boris Godunov, Coronation Scene"
./images/419.jpg	AMERLING, Friedrich von	Oil on canvas	From the early 1830s to approximately 1850 Amerling was Vienna's most celebrated portraitist. A likeness, almost identical to this portrait and entitled Modest Susanna, was executed in 1837.The portrait represents an example of one of Amerling's favourite compositional schemata to position the bare-backed sitter, turned away from the beholder. Effective highlights lend a soft gleam to the young face and betray the influence ofThomas Lawrence's art of portraiture.
./images/420.jpg	AMERLING, Friedrich von	Oil on panel	Amerling worked in a style that combined the elegance of British portraiture with the realism of the Viennese Biedermeier tradition. His sitters included not only members of the royal family but also the wealthy upper classes, prominent citizens and even fellow artists. He also produced a number of portrait studies such as this picture, which show just the sitter's head. These studies are notable for their spontaneity and immediacy.

./images/423.jpg	AMERLING, Friedrich von	Oil on canvas	The Countess Nákó, née Berta Gyertyánffy (1820-82), the wife of a Transylvanian aristocrat who lived in Vienna and Pest alternatively, was an exceptional personality. While her contemporaries appeared timid and docile, she was a self-assured woman. She is seated at her desk in a dignified pose; the writing utensils indicate that her interest went beyond the narrow limits of family life. She learnt to paint from Amerling; she was an excellent pianist, as well as a composer of music. Her salon was frequented by musicians and painters, including Richard Wagner and Franz Liszt. Amerling did not disguise the countess's magnetic, matured womanliness. By including personal objects and the dog nuzzling to its mistress, in the grandiose composition, Amerling created a portrait which is near to genre painting.

./images/425.jpg	AMERLING, Friedrich von	Oil on canvas	In this unfinished self-portrait the artist depicted himself in profile from the left and with a serious and attentive look. He dispensed with any attributes of his art, such as brush or easel, and did not adopt an artificial pose, contenting himself with a clearly circumscribed partial view.

./images/427.jpg	AMICO FRIULANO DEL DOSSO	Oil on canvas	This painting depicts a gentleman with a sword, three-quarter length, a landscape with a walled city beyond. Strong contrasts between light and dark define the painting: the beams of light from the leaden sky pick out certain parts of the landscape while other passages remain in penumbra. Nothing is known about the identity of the sitter; on the basis of the style of the costume, the portrait can be dated to 1515-20. The town in the background could possibly be Cividale, in Friuli.The portrait has borne many different attributions over the years, from Titian to Dosso to Lorenzo Lotto, while Federico Zeri classified it as a work by Girolamo Marchesi da Cotignola. The attribution to the Amico Friulano del Dosso is, however, by far the most convincing.

./images/430.jpg	AMIGONI, Jacopo	Oil on canvas	Juno (Greek Hera) was the chief goddess of Olympus, both the sister and wife of Jupiter (Zeus). Her role in myth and are is principally that of the wife of a faithless husband, always plotting revenge on his many lovers. Her usual attribute is the peacock which was sacred to her in antiquity. In one of the affairs of Jupiter, the giant Argus of hundred eyes was set by Juno to watch over Io, the lover of Jupiter. When Argus was murdered by Mercury, in memory of Argus Juno took his eyes and set them in the tail of her peacock (Met. 1:721-4).Juno and Mercury, one of four mythologies painted by Amigoni for Moor Park, remains too little idealized, and faintly ludicrous. Imagination has been less exercised than industry; Amigoni's people are real enough to be commonplace - and to feel somewhat at ease when shown sitting on clouds. with Amigoni the rococo remains solid and earthbound.
./images/431.jpg	AMIGONI, Jacopo	Oil on canvas	The painting represents a lady, three-quarter length, wearing a blue and white velvet dress and seated in a sumptuous interior.
./images/432.jpg	AMIGONI, Jacopo	Oil on canvas	This painting relates the story of Jael and Sisera in tones of delicate colours that contrast emphatically with the drama of the biblical event recounted. It was painted after the artist's return too Venice from travels that took him to most of Europe, when his palette became brighter and more refined.Sisera was a cruel Canaanite leader who ruled the Israelites for twenty years. Barak defeated his nine hundred charioteers by a surprise Israelite attack. Sisera escaped and sought refuge in the tent of Jael, wife of Heber the Kenite. She gave the terrified Canaanite sanctuary. When he fell asleep, she drove a tent peg into his brain. The act fulfilled the prediction of Debora, prophetess and Israelite leader, who foresaw that a woman would slay Sisera.
./images/433.jpg	AMIGONI, Jacopo	Oil on canvas	Born in Naples but trained as an artist in Venice, Jacopo Amigoni soon began working in the Rococo style. Like Sebastiano Ricci and Pellegrino he often left Venice to work as one of Europe's foremost cosmopolitan artists, fixing the evanescent rather fragile delicacy of his style in great frescoes and paintings of historical subjects both profane and sacred. Charmingly Rococo in taste are the small canvases too, usually with some mythological or courtly subject. A typical example of this type is the painting of 'Venus and Adonis', executed with arcadian grace in the sharpness of the composition and the clarity and softness of the colours soaked in a jewelled and diaphanous luminosity.The story of Venus and Adonis, which has attracted not only artists but poets, including Shakespeare, tells that Adonis was the offspring of the incestuous union of King Cinyras of Paphos, in Cyprus, with his daughter Myrrha. His beauty was a byword. Venus conceived a helpless passion for him as a result of a chance graze she received from Cupid's arrow (Met. 10:524-559). One day while out hunting Adonis was slain by a wild boar, an accident Venus had always dreaded (Met. 10:708-739). Hearing his dying groans as she flew overhead in her chariot, she came down to aid him but was too late. In the place where the earth was stained with Adonis' blood, anemones sprouted. Artists usually depict two scenes, Amigoni painted both.The first scene is shown on this picture. Adonis, arrow (spear in other versions) in hand and hunting dog (or dogs) straining at the leash, is impatient to be off, while Venus imploringly tries to hold him back.

./images/436.jpg	AMIGONI, Jacopo	Oil on canvas	Amigoni moved to London in 1729, where he remained for a decade, enjoying much success and significant patronage among the English aristocracy. During his stay in England, the artist provided large-scale mythological and historical scenes and decorative schemes for the country's many stately homes.

./images/438.jpg	AMIGONI, Jacopo	Oil on canvas	Amigoni had spent his early career in Venice, but he left the city to make a name for himself as an international artist, quickly finding an avid audience in the various courts of Europe which had developed a taste for the charm of the Venetian Rococo. In 1730, Amigoni arrived in London fresh from a series of pictorial triumphs in Venice, Rome and at the court of the Elector of Bavaria, and soon had eager patrons amongst the English nobility and even royalty.The pair of canvases of mythological subjects, Venus and Adonis, and Bacchus and Ariadne, represent one of the most important works by Amigoni from his seminal English sojourn. These subjects represent two of the most recognizable and classic of all mythological stories, both with a rich history of pictorial representation in Venetian art. They are taken from Ovid's Metamorphoses, and in the case of Venus and Adonis, Amigoni returned to the subject throughout his career.

This posthumous portrait of Rossini, who spent several decades in the French capital where he was known for his sharp wit, appears to have been executed from a photograph, as its oval format may indicate. In the wave of renewed Italian nationalism, the painting may have been intended as a symbolic gesture to bring the Italian composer back to his native country.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 8 minutes):Gioacchino Rossini: L'Italiana in Algeri, overture

./images/480.jpg	ANDERSON, William	Oil on canvas	"The painting depicts an English 3rd-rate ship of the line (74 guns) in three positions off Table Mountain, Cape Town, South Africa, flying the Royal Nay ensign.The popularity and prestige of the large two-decker 74-gun Ships of the line (""74"") reached its peak during the French Revolutionary War when the British found that not only did they sail better than the stately three-decker but that by superior gunnery and training their two-deckers could be a match for any enemy warship, even three-deckers of over one hundred guns. Napoleon Bonaparte was sent to St Helena in the Northumberland 74 after he had surrendered to the captain of Bellerophon 74. For years the very words seventy-four were synonymous to the British public with an invincible naval supremacy."

./images/484.jpg	ANDREA DA FIRENZE	Fresco	The end wall (the north wall) of the chancel chapel is devoted entirely to three scenes from the Passion of Christ: the Bearing of the Cross at bottom left, the Crucifixion in the middle, and the Descent into Hell at bottom right. The Crucifixion extends over the entire width of the upper wall segment as a multifigure image of Golgotha. In this scene the crosses of the two thieves create recessional axes into space, although the actual space depicted is relatively shallow. The thieves twist convulsively on their crosses while a group of figures runs from an attacking soldier at the right.The Crucifixion image derives from Sienese examples such as Simone Martini's fresco in the lower church  of San Francesco, Assisi, and Lippo Memmi's fresco in the Collegiata, San Gimignano.The thematic continuation of the Passion scenes is found on the vault frescoes in the Resurrection, the Miracle of Pentecost, and the Ascension of Christ.

More recently it has been described as the ""Via veritatis,"" the Church as the Path to Salvation. In addition to the idea of making the observer aware, via images, of the official church and its institutions as the true path to salvation, the intention was also to emphasize, among the institutions of the Church, the Dominican order and its work.The sequence of pictorial motifs begins in the lower left quarter of the image with the depiction of Ecclesia in the form of a large church building patterned after the Florence Cathedral. In front of the side wall of the Cathedral, we can see the hierarchic order of the medieval society: the Pope, at his left the Emperor and King, a prince, at his right the Dominican general and a bishop.
