    "\n",
    "## Class Initialization\n",
    "- The `Vocabulary` class is initialized with a name.\n",
    "- It initializes three tokens (`PAD_token`, `SOS_token`, `EOS_token`) which are used for padding short sentences, marking the start of a sentence, and marking the end of a sentence respectively.\n",
    "- It initializes dictionaries to store mappings between words and indices, and vice versa.\n",
    "- It also tracks the number of words, sentences, and the length of the longest sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method: add_word\n",
    "- This method adds a word to the vocabulary.\n",
    "- If the word is not already in the vocabulary, it assigns it a unique index and initializes its count to 1.\n",
    "- If the word already exists in the vocabulary, it simply increments its count.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method: add_sentence\n",
    "- This method adds a sentence to the vocabulary.\n",
    "- It splits the sentence into words, adds each word using the `add_word` method, and updates the length of the longest sentence.\n",
    "- It also increments the count of sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method: to_word\n",
    "- This method converts an index to its corresponding word in the vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method: to_index\n",
    "- This method converts a word to its corresponding index in the vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method: len\n",
    "- This method returns the total number of words in the vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "- After defining the `Vocabulary` class, an instance of it named `vocab` is created with the name 'art'.\n",
    "- Then, it iterates through sentences (presumably contained in a variable called `data['description']`), tokenizes each sentence into words using NLTK's `word_tokenize` function, and adds each word to the vocabulary using the `add_word` method."

    "- It stores these parameters as attributes for later use.\n",
    "\n",

    "- This method returns the length of the dataset, which is the number of samples (images) in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method: __getitem__\n",
    "- This method is used to retrieve a single item (image and caption pair) from the dataset given an index.\n",
    "- It loads the image corresponding to the index using PIL's `Image.open` function and converts it to RGB format.\n",
    "- If a transformation is provided, it applies the transformation to the image.\n",
    "- It tokenizes the caption using NLTK's `word_tokenize` function, appending start-of-sentence (`SOS`) and end-of-sentence (`EOS`) tokens to the tokenized caption.\n",
    "- If the length of the tokenized caption exceeds the maximum caption length, it truncates it; otherwise, it pads it with `PAD` tokens to match the maximum length.\n",
    "- It then converts the tokens to indices using a predefined vocabulary (`vocab`) and creates a PyTorch tensor from the indices.\n",

    "## Dataset Instantiation\n",
    "- After defining the `ArtDataset` class, two instances of it (`train_dataset` and `test_dataset`) are created using training and validation data (`X_train`, `y_train`, `X_val`, `y_val`), respectively.\n",

    "## Encoder Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Encoder` class is responsible for extracting meaningful features from input data, typically images, and transforming them into a format suitable for further processing by the decoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initialization\n",
    "- **Embedding Dimension (`embed_dim`)**: This parameter specifies the dimensionality of the output feature vectors produced by the encoder.\n",
    "- **Batch Normalization Momentum (`batch_norm_momentum`)**: Momentum value used for batch normalization.\n",
    "- **Dropout Probability (`dropout`)**: Dropout probability for regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Components\n",
    "1. **DenseNet-201 Backbone**: The encoder utilizes the DenseNet-201 architecture, a deep convolutional neural network pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. DenseNet-201 consists of densely connected blocks, enabling feature reuse and efficient feature propagation.\n",
    "2. **Freezing Pre-trained Weights**: The parameters of the DenseNet-201 backbone are frozen (`requires_grad = False`), preventing them from being updated during training to retain the learned features.\n",
    "3. **Linear Layer (`embed`)**: Adjusts the output features from the DenseNet-201 classifier to the desired embedding dimension (`embed_dim`). This layer reduces the dimensionality of the feature vectors.\n",
    "4. **Batch Normalization (`batch`)**: Applies batch normalization to normalize the output features and improve training stability. It adjusts the mean and variance of each feature dimension.\n",
    "5. **Dropout Layer**: Randomly drops a fraction of the input features during training to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.\n",
    "6. **Initialization**: Weights of the linear layer are initialized with normal distribution (mean=0, standard deviation=0.1), and bias is initialized to zeros.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Forward Pass\n",
    "- **Input Processing**: Takes images (`imgs`) as input.\n",
    "- **Feature Extraction**: Passes the input images through the DenseNet-201 backbone to extract high-level features. The DenseNet architecture efficiently captures spatial hierarchies in the images.\n",
    "- **Dropout Regularization**: Applies dropout to the extracted features to prevent overfitting by randomly setting a fraction of the features to zero during training.\n",
    "- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Projects the extracted features to the desired embedding dimension using a linear layer. This step reduces the dimensionality of the feature vectors while preserving relevant information.\n",
    "- **Batch Normalization**: Normalizes the output features using batch normalization, ensuring stable training by scaling and shifting the features.\n",
    "- **Output**: Returns the processed features as the output of the encoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "The `Encoder` class employs the DenseNet-201 architecture to extract informative features from input images. By reducing dimensionality, applying batch normalization, and employing dropout regularization, the encoder prepares the features for further processing by the decoder, facilitating the generation of accurate and descriptive captions.\n"

    "\n",
    "The `Decoder` class take the encoded image features, often extracted by the encoder, and transform them into descriptive text captions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initialization\n",
    "- **Embedding Size (`embed_size`)**: This parameter defines the size of the word embedding vectors. Word embeddings are dense, continuous-valued representations of words in a vector space.\n",
    "- **Hidden Size (`hidden_size`)**: This parameter specifies the size of the hidden state in the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) layer. The hidden state captures information from previous time steps.\n",
    "- **Vocabulary Size (`vocab_size`)**: The size of the vocabulary, i.e., the total number of unique words in the language.\n",
    "- **Dropout Probability (`dropout`)**: Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly sets a fraction of input units to zero during training to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Components\n",
    "1. **Attention Mechanism**: The decoder utilizes an attention mechanism to selectively focus on different regions of the input image features while generating captions. This allows the model to attend to relevant parts of the image during each step of caption generation.\n",
    "2. **Embedding Layer**: Converts word indices into dense vectors of fixed size (`embed_size`). This layer essentially learns the semantic representations of words based on their context in the captions.\n",
    "3. **LSTM Layer**: The LSTM processes sequential input data and maintains hidden states across time steps. It takes embedded word vectors as input and produces output sequences. The hidden state captures context information and helps in capturing long-range dependencies.\n",
    "4. **Linear Layer**: Maps the output of the LSTM to a space with dimensionality equal to the vocabulary size. This layer produces logits for each word in the vocabulary, representing the likelihood of each word being the next word in the sequence.\n",
    "5. **Sigmoid Layer**: A sigmoid function used to compute the gating mechanism for attention. It helps in controlling the attention mechanism, determining the relevance of different parts of the image features.\n",
    "6. **Initialization**: Weights for the embedding and linear layers are initialized within a certain range to ensure effective learning during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Forward Pass\n",
    "- **Input Processing**: Takes image features (`features`) and ground truth captions (`captions`) as inputs.\n",
    "- **Embedding and Concatenation**: Embeds the captions using the embedding layer and concatenates them with the image features. This combined representation is used as input for subsequent processing.\n",
    "- **LSTM Computation**: Passes the concatenated input through the LSTM, computing attention-weighted encoding. This step captures the contextual information from both the image features and the previously generated words in the captions.\n",
    "- **Attention Mechanism**: Applies a gating mechanism to the attention-weighted encoding, determining the importance of different parts of the image features in generating the next word.\n",
    "- **Output Generation**: Generates logits for each word in the vocabulary using a linear layer. These logits represent the model's confidence in predicting each word in the vocabulary.\n",
    "- **Regularization**: Applies dropout regularization to the output sequence to prevent overfitting during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sampling Methods\n",
    "- **Greedy Sampling (`sample`)**: Selects the word with the highest probability at each time step to form the sequence. This method tends to produce coherent but potentially repetitive captions.\n",
    "- **Combined Sampling (`sample_combined_search`)**: Combines the sampling from top-k and nucleus sampling methods to enhance diversity and reduce repetition in the generated captions. \n",
    "- **Top-k Sampling (`top_k_sampling`)**: Samples from the top k most likely words at each time step, enhancing diversity in the generated captions.\n",
    "- **Nucleus Sampling (`nucleus_sampling`)**: Samples from the set of words whose cumulative probability mass exceeds a certain threshold (`p`). This method promotes diversity while controlling the number of possible words sampled.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "The `Decoder` class is a fundamental component of image captioning models, responsible for converting visual information into textual descriptions. Through a combination of attention mechanisms, recurrent neural networks, and sampling techniques, the decoder effectively generates captions that capture the essence of the input images.\n"

    "\n",
    "## Conversion Process\n",
    "- The function iterates over the predicted word indices (`sampled_ids`).\n",
    "- For each word index, it retrieves the corresponding word from the vocabulary using the `index2word` mapping.\n",
    "- It appends the word to the `sampled_caption` list.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "This function plays a crucial role in converting the output of the decoder (predicted word indices) into human-readable captions. It utilizes the vocabulary mapping (`index2word`) to perform the conversion, enabling the model to generate descriptive captions for images.\n"

    "# `rouge_score` Function Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "This function computes the ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) score for the generated captions by the Show and Tell model on the validation dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Function Parameters\n",
    "- `testloader`: The data loader for validation images and captions.\n",
    "- `encoder`: The encoder model used for feature extraction.\n",
    "- `decoder`: The decoder model used for caption generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ROUGE Score Computation\n",
    "- The function imports the `load_metric` function from the `datasets` library, which is used to load the ROUGE metric.\n",
    "- It sets the encoder and decoder models to evaluation mode using the `eval()` method.\n",
    "- The function iterates over the batches of validation data provided by `testloader`.\n",
    "- For each batch:\n",
    "  - It moves the images to the appropriate device (CPU or GPU).\n",
    "  - It extracts features from the images using the encoder.\n",
    "  - It generates captions for the images using the decoder's `sample_combined_search` method, which combines `top_k` and `nucleus` sampling.\n",
    "  - It converts the indices of the generated captions to actual words using the vocabulary (`vocab`).\n",
    "  - It adds the generated captions and ground truth captions to the ROUGE metric using the `add` method.\n",
    "- Finally, the function computes the ROUGE score using the `compute` method of the ROUGE metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ROUGE Score\n",
    "- The ROUGE score is a metric commonly used to evaluate the quality of machine-generated text summaries. It measures the overlap of n-grams (typically up to 4-grams) between the generated captions and the reference captions, focusing on recall rather than precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "This function evaluates the quality of the generated captions by computing the ROUGE score, providing a quantitative measure of the model's performance in generating captions that capture the essence of the ground truth captions.\n",
