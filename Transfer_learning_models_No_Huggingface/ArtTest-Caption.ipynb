    "- The `Vocabulary` class is initialized with a name.\n",
    "- It initializes three tokens (`PAD_token`, `SOS_token`, `EOS_token`) which are used for padding short sentences, marking the start of a sentence, and marking the end of a sentence respectively.\n",
    "- It initializes dictionaries to store mappings between words and indices, and vice versa.\n",
    "- It also tracks the number of words, sentences, and the length of the longest sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method: add_word\n",
    "- This method adds a word to the vocabulary.\n",
    "- If the word is not already in the vocabulary, it assigns it a unique index and initializes its count to 1.\n",
    "- If the word already exists in the vocabulary, it simply increments its count.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method: add_sentence\n",
    "- This method adds a sentence to the vocabulary.\n",
    "- It splits the sentence into words, adds each word using the `add_word` method, and updates the length of the longest sentence.\n",
    "- It also increments the count of sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method: to_word\n",
    "- This method converts an index to its corresponding word in the vocabulary.\n",

    "- This method converts a word to its corresponding index in the vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method: len\n",

    "## Usage\n",
    "- After defining the `Vocabulary` class, an instance of it named `vocab` is created with the name 'art'.\n",
    "- Then, it iterates through sentences (presumably contained in a variable called `data['description']`), tokenizes each sentence into words using NLTK's `word_tokenize` function, and adds each word to the vocabulary using the `add_word` method."

    "\n",
    "## Class Initialization\n",
    "- The `ArtDataset` class is initialized with image data, corresponding labels (captions), an optional transformation for images, and a maximum caption length.\n",
    "- It stores these parameters as attributes for later use.\n",
    "\n",

    "- This method returns the length of the dataset, which is the number of samples (images) in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method: __getitem__\n",
    "- This method is used to retrieve a single item (image and caption pair) from the dataset given an index.\n",
    "- It loads the image corresponding to the index using PIL's `Image.open` function and converts it to RGB format.\n",
    "- If a transformation is provided, it applies the transformation to the image.\n",
    "- It tokenizes the caption using NLTK's `word_tokenize` function, appending start-of-sentence (`SOS`) and end-of-sentence (`EOS`) tokens to the tokenized caption.\n",
    "- If the length of the tokenized caption exceeds the maximum caption length, it truncates it; otherwise, it pads it with `PAD` tokens to match the maximum length.\n",
    "- It then converts the tokens to indices using a predefined vocabulary (`vocab`) and creates a PyTorch tensor from the indices.\n",
    "- Finally, it returns a tuple containing the processed image and the tokenized caption.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Instantiation\n",
    "- After defining the `ArtDataset` class, two instances of it (`train_dataset` and `val_dataset`) are created using training and validation data (`X_train`, `y_train`, `X_val`, `y_val`), respectively.\n",

    "### Explanation:\n",
    "- The `Encoder` class employs a pre-trained ResNet-50 model for image feature extraction.\n",
    "  - **Rationale**: ResNet-50 is a deep convolutional neural network known for its effectiveness in image classification tasks. By utilizing a pre-trained ResNet-50 model, the encoder benefits from the high-level features learned from a large dataset (like ImageNet), allowing it to capture rich image representations.\n",
    "- The encoder freezes the ResNet-50 weights and removes the last fully connected layer.\n",
    "  - **Rationale**: Freezing the weights prevents them from being updated during training, which helps preserve the learned features of the ResNet-50 model. Removing the last fully connected layer simplifies the model and prepares it for feature extraction.\n",
    "- The extracted features are projected onto a lower-dimensional space using a linear layer.\n",
    "  - **Rationale**: Projecting the high-dimensional features onto a lower-dimensional space reduces computational complexity while retaining the most relevant information. This helps in training and improves generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Attention\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "- The `Attention` mechanism calculates attention weights based on the similarity between encoder features and decoder hidden states.\n",
    "  - **Rationale**: By calculating attention weights, the model can dynamically focus on different parts of the image when generating captions. This enables the model to attend to relevant image regions while generating each word of the caption, improving the quality and relevance of the generated captions.\n",
    "- The attention weights are used to compute a weighted sum of encoder features, providing context information to the decoder.\n",
    "  - **Rationale**: Incorporating context information helps the decoder generate more informative and coherent captions by considering relevant image regions at each decoding step.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Decoder\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "- The `Decoder` class generates captions based on the extracted features and attention mechanism.\n",
    "  - **Rationale**: By using an LSTM-based decoder, the model can capture the sequential nature of language and generate captions word by word. The LSTM's ability to retain long-term dependencies helps in generating coherent and contextually relevant captions.\n",
    "- The decoder employs an LSTM to generate a sequence of words.\n",
    "  - **Rationale**: LSTMs are well-suited for sequential data modeling tasks like language generation. They can capture dependencies between words in a sentence, making them suitable for generating captions.\n",
    "- At each step, the attention mechanism provides context information to the decoder.\n",
    "  - **Rationale**: Incorporating attention helps the model focus on relevant image regions while generating each word of the caption, improving the overall quality of the generated captions.\n",
    "- The decoding process continues until an end token is generated or a maximum sequence length is reached.\n",
    "  - **Rationale**: Ending the caption generation process upon encountering an end token ensures that the model produces captions of fixed length. Additionally, imposing a maximum sequence length helps prevent the model from generating overly long or repetitive captions, enhancing the efficiency and relevance of the generated captions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "This detailed explanation highlights the rationale behind the architectural choices made in the Show and Tell model. By leveraging pre-trained ResNet-50 for feature extraction, incorporating attention mechanism for context-aware caption generation, and using LSTM-based decoder for sequential language modeling, the model achieves the capability to generate descriptive and contextually relevant captions for images. These choices are grounded in the principles of effective feature representation, attentional focus, and sequential modeling, enabling the model to produce high-quality image captions.\n"

    "- The function iterates over the predicted word indices (`sampled_ids`).\n",
