("Francisco Barrera became an important figure in the artistic community in Madrid during the 1630s and 1640s, when he took over leadership of the painters' guild. However, he remained a relatively undistinguished master in the panorama of painting at the Spanish court. Like many other painters of limited talents, Barrera was an all-rounder whose production centred on religious subjects, images of saints, landscapes and still-lifes. Like Juan de Arellano, Barrera worked for the open market and sold his paintings from a shop in the centre of Madrid. The rise in popularity of still-life and flower paintings among collectors in Madrid during the middle years of the century doubtlessly encouraged Barrera to turn to this genre. Although his religious paintings are unknown today, his still-life paintings show that he developed a distinct personality in paintings of this type.This painting represents lilies and carnations in an oriental-style vase, the freshness of the lilies denoted by the fact that only five of the blooms have opened. Alongside these, there is a plate of cherries and apricots, that are kept cool by pieces of snow from the wine cooler. The representation on the vase of a monkey picking fruit whimsically relates this object to the fruit collected in the bowl in the picture. A jug of water is placed in the background and in the foreground a pie rests on a napkin, with a knife.The painting typifies Barrera's style in still-life and flower painting. He has sharply defined the forms and details of the flowers, and a certain hardness in their facture reflects the influence of the flower paintings of Juan van der Hamen and Antonio Ponce, the latter working with Barrera on decorative painting projects at the Buen Retiro in the 1630s.Suggested listening (streaming mp3, 2 minutes):Franz Schubert: Blumenlied (Flower Song) D 431", 'The painting shows a scene in the Roman Campagna with a capriccio view of Tivoli and a bolt of lightning. In this, as in other Arcadian landscapes painted by the artist, Van Bloemen shows his skill in rendering different atmospheric effects. We sense the storm moving swiftly over the landscape, the storm-clouds being driven by a wind which bends trees under its force. The bolt of lightning in the centre of the painting is a motif which recurs in other paintings by Van Bloemen, but never on the same scale or with the same dramatic emphasis as it does here.', 'The tall figure of Bazille, leaning on the easel that bears his View of the Village (MusÃ©e Fabre, Montpellier), was apparently painted by Manet, who is the one wearing a hat, shown giving his young friend some advice.', "This painting represents a three quarter length portrait of the artist's husband Charles Beale (1632-1705), dressed in an open-necked shirt with brown gown, his left hand resting on a large folio book which stands on a table. Charles Beale assumed responsibility for organizing his wife's commissions and payments. He recorded these details and much other incidental information in a series of notebooks, which provide an exceptional amount of documentation for an artist of this period.The canvas is contained in a fine 17th-century carved and gilded frame.", "The four panels with Allegories at the Accademia in Venice are often likened to the Sacred Allegory, but they belong instead to the artist's scanty secular production. They originally formed part of a small dressing-table with a mirror and a rack on which to hang objects, belonging to the painter Vincenzo Catena who, writing his will in 1530, left it to Antonio Marsili. The spread of this kind of furniture was so great that in 1489 the Venetian Senate prohibited its manufacture, limiting it to what was strictly necessary. Often, as in this instance, their decoration comprised symbolic representations of a moralistic character.An unusual theme for Bellini, the panels represent respectively: Lust tempting the virtuous man or Perseverance (Bacchus who from a chariot offers a plate of fruit to a warrior); fickle Fortune (the woman on an unstable boat holding a sphere); Prudence (the naked woman pointing at a mirror); Falsehood (the man emerging from the shell). There are diverging opinions about the interpretation of the last two representations, such that they have been seen as: the Woman as Vanitas (on the basis of similar representations by Jacopo de' Barbari and Baldung Grien), and the Man in the shell as an allegory of Virtus Sapientia, since the shell might have a positive connotation as a generative principle.", 'Leonhard van Eck (1480-1550) was the chancellor to Duke Wilhelm IV of Bavaria, who was the patron of Barthel Beham. He opposed the Reformation and supported the Wittelsbach cause against the Habsburg monarchs.The identification of the portrait is based on an engraving bearing the initials of Barthel Beham that also provides the name of the sitter, his age (47) and the date (1527). It is proposed that both the painting and the engraving are based on a now-lost drawing by the artist.', "Barocci was profoundly influenced by the works of Correggio, as seen in his celebrated Madonna del Popolo. Barocci emphasizes the dramatic instant of the Virgin's intercession for her people before a loving Christ..The scene is caught up in a bewitching fusion of everyday experience with otherworldly rapture.", 'The woodcut opens Daniele Barbaro\'s edition of Vitruvius (I Dieci libri dell\'architettura di M. Vitruvio tradutti e commentati da Monsignor Barbaro, eletto patriarca d\'Acquileggia, Venice 1556), published in 1556, mirroring Barbaro\'s views on architectural theory, and presumably shows the scholar himself in the middle of an accumulation of sundry appliances and instruments.Cog wheel, block and tackle and tongs allude to the practical activities of the architect. The tortoise and mobile assault shelter derive originally from the military sphere. They were for the Roman army\'s protection when advancing. Barbaro is here following an older tradition of Vitruvius exegesis, which describes the vault of the ancient basilica in Fano built by Vitruvius as analogous to the carapace of a tortoise. Translated into architectural terms, the mobile shelter became a pitched roof. In the background, arches and vaults as the epitome of classical architecture are contrasted with "modern" contemporary architecture, with the Ionic ascribed to Barbaro corresponding the order used in the faÃ§ade of his mansion in Maser. An interest in architecture also meant, for Barbaro, studying astronomy. Its importance is underlined by the sundial, linking the earthly world with the stars and the sphere in front of the scholar.', 'The picture shows the angel of the Annuciation wearing precious garment embroidered with gold.', "For the Florentine Compagnia dello Scalzo, Andrea del Sarto frescoed the atrium of the brotherhood's chapel. The artist worked on it from 1509 to 1526, with interruptions. A frieze depicts the life of John the Baptist, the patron saint of the brotherhood. Sarto executed the entire decoration in grisaille. This did not just save the brotherhood money, the renunciation of colour also express the rigor and humility of its communal ideal.", "About 1770, sculptors firmly bound to the classical ideal began to emerge. The taste for heroic Classicism encouraged a more severe and historical style. The English sculptor Thomas Banks was preeminent among its proponents. On his return to England from Rome, where he had a considerable success, Banks continued to produce nude, heroic dramas that were well received by the Royal Academy, but his career centred on the production of less severe funerary monuments. Late in his career, the wars with France provided him with the chance of combining the two. He was commissioned to carve two of the monuments commemorating military officers fallen in the wars with France that were being erected in St Paul's Cathedral in London. The resultant mixture of nudity with portraiture is striking.Richard Rundle Burgess (c. 1755-1797) was a naval officer.", "The monumental altarpiece is one of the artists's most important works. Here the divine miracle is blended with the joy of the actual birth.", 'On the left St Peter the Martyr is represented as being murdered by Pietro da Balsamo, a heretic. On the right another monk, Fra Domenico, tries to escape in vain.', 'Two workers with shovels and sieves descend to the waters of the Mugnone stream, a tributary of the Arno, in order to dig for sand that is needed for construction work. Judging from the cool and silvery palette, this rendering is presumably an early morning scene. Along with Telemaco Signorini and Vincenzo Cabianca, Borrani practiced en plein air painting, preferring, however, minute details and a darker palette than his fellow painters.', "Simon Bening, Alexander Bening's son, was also an accomplished manuscript painter and is well known for his technical innovations in the art of storytelling. One of his narrative cycles included sixty-four miniatures on the life of Christ. Today, the densely packed parchment pages are rearranged on four panels in the Walters Art Gallery Baltimore. Each panel of the so-called Stein Polyptych includes sixteen images. The present panel is the second of the series with depictions from the Baptism to the Arrest of Christ. The individual scenes are tightly cropped, producing dramatic close-ups.", "This is one of Blechen's several studies of a funerary monument, suggesting grandeur and pathos.")
