# Art Critic Model

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

## Introduction

The Art Critic Model project aims to develop a sophisticated computational model capable of analyzing art pieces, particularly paintings, and generating critic-like descriptions of them. Additionally, the model provides the functionality to input a description and select a different artistic style, resulting in the generation of a new image that embodies the chosen style.

## Implementation Approaches

The project is implemented using two distinct approaches:

1. Fine-tuning Models: This approach leverages pre-trained models for classification and image-to-text tasks from the Hugging Face library. These models are fine-tuned on a carefully curated dataset of art pieces, enabling them to generate accurate and insightful descriptions. By fine-tuning these models, we ensure that they capture the nuances and intricacies specific to the domain of art criticism.

2. Transfer Learning: In this approach, transfer learning techniques are employed with state-of-the-art models such as ResNet and ResNext. By utilizing transfer learning, we can leverage the knowledge and features learned from large-scale datasets to create new models specifically designed for image captioning and classification tasks in the context of art. These models are trained on an extensive collection of art pieces, enabling them to learn the distinctive patterns and characteristics inherent in various artistic styles.
